Meaning, they may have to review appraisals for homes that are not in the best condition and need extensive rehab.Candidates on the origination side are also placing the value whereas this team is reviewing the appraisal that was provided and reviewing all appraisal documents to provide their “stamp of approval” on the value and not performing the actual appraisal.Reviews are completed at one at a time, and 12-15 reviews completed daily is a good KPI to shoot for.QualificationsMust have experience with BPO formsMust have an Active Appraiser License/Certification (in good standing), and experience not only appraising but also reviewing appraisals.This is a desk job; you will not be traveling to the field at allCandidates with Alamode is a good application to look for on candidates resumes.Candidates will need to be equipped to make a clear decision on approval of appraisal with minimal supervision.Since they will not be providing the standard pre-review that most appraisers do, they do not have to have geographical competency as they will be reviewing properties across the US.Candidate must be able to adapt to technology and work independently.They use various proprietary systems, but Outlook and Skype is a must.They are 100% a paperless environment, so again, technology is keyJob Types: Full-time, ContractPay: $29.00 - $31.00 per hourBenefits:Health insuranceSchedule:8 hour shiftEducation:Bachelor's (Preferred)Experience:Microsoft Excel: 1 year (Preferred)Analysis Skills: 1 year (Preferred)Contract Renewal:LikelyWork Location:One locationBenefit Conditions:Waiting period may applyWork Remotely:Yes"

They reach out to us for support, and as an Alpha Advocate, you simply talk through their options with them on the phone, options they are already aware of: Launch Your Dating Life, Become A Benevolent Badass, and others.LOGISTICS:  This is a remote part-time contractor position, paid on a commission basis. You’ll be taking calls with our guys in the afternoons and evenings during launches (concentrated sales times for a couple of weeks at a time, a handful of times per year), and you may get an appointment here or there when we are not having a launch.COMPENSATION:  Our programs range from $1,800 to $7,000.

It is an adventure every day! There is so much to learn about business, and so much to love about the special men we serve.Our Direction: Right out of the gate back in 2014 and 2015, we were approached by leading experts in the industry asking to get to know us and entail our support and wisdom.We get emails daily from our readers, colleagues, and clients THANKING US from the bottom of their hearts for being here, for making such a difference in their lives.It is an honor to be making an indelible impact in the market, and we look forward to flourishing together in years to come: you, me, our growing team, our clients, readers, and everyone who is positively influenced by the work we’re doing.We are full of positive energy and strategic curiosity over how to support our guys better every day. Joy is what this company runs on, and we are very grateful for that.Who Are Our Clients?They are smart, introverted men who value integrity, adventure, connection, and fun. As entrepreneurs, engineers, outdoorists, foodies, leaders, and wanderers, they are thoughtful, patient, kind, and strong.They are ready to grow and develop to the next level with dating, social leadership, confidence, and more. Many times, they just haven’t found the resources or guidance to do that in a way that feels honest and true to them until they find US.That’s where you come in: helping bridge the gap between them finding us and working together. If it’s a fit. you’ll help them take that step into the best program for them, and along with that, the 1:1 care of a devoted IA Coach.Introverted Alpha is founded on LOVE for these men: genuine love and respect.

You’ll be following up with potential clients after your calls, as you might have more than one call per potential client.Logistics of expected workload:  It’s important that you’re available in a very quiet, peaceful place for the exploration calls and that you’re able to check and respond to emails a few times daily on weekdays.Your Strengths & Background: You’re a critical thinker and a problem solver. You get to the heart of the matter and ask great questions.You help people feel comfortable to open up and at ease around you.You are professional and clear with your communication.Also, you love helping people.

So much of our world is different right now, particularly in the workplace.

We have a ridiculous amount of support for our sales team including:
Personal and group coaching designed to take your skills and abilities to the next level.
Technology, tools, and automation created to get rid of the mundane, repetitive tasks that bog down most salespeople.
The time to dominate this market is now, and it’s time for you to come and show off what you can accomplish!

Lightweight programs designed to drive business, not HR outcomes
An inclusive and supportive environment and champion inclusivity across your client group
This will sound super exciting to you if you are:
A person who wants to do the full scope of HR tasks - from strategic thinking and planning to rolling up their sleeves and working on tactical, day-to-day stuff
Someone who likes data and knows employment law across the US (with a deep knowledge of California employment law) but more important, knows how to use it in practice to support business stakeholders
Someone who is upbeat, flexible and excited by fast pace (seriously fast) and not scared by quick decision making (and decision changing) processes.
And you understand how tech start-ups work, have experience in tech start-up and working with a variety of Sales and customer facing roles :)

Research has shown that more than half of patients will abandon their prescriptions at the pharmacy when their out of pocket cost is $125 or more. The shift to high- deductible health plans and higher co-pays means that even insured individuals are increasingly paying more for their prescription drugs out of their own pockets. 8% are cutting pills in half putting themselves at risk by endangering their health.Even Medicare patients often have high prescription drug co pays, eventually fall into the “doughnut hole” and need help with Rx costs. Plus there are many medications that Medicare just doesn’t cover.Circulation Dec 2019 – “I in 8 patients with Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease report nonadherence to medication regimens because of cost, resorting to skipping doses, breaking tablets and taking a lesser dose than prescribed and delaying filling of prescriptions to save money.”Gallop Poll Reported in Nov 2019 – “About 1 in 5 US Adults say they or someone in their household has been unable to afford drugs that were prescribed to them in the last year. 22.9% in Nov, up from 18.9% in Jan. 58 million adults experience “medication insecurity.”Annals of Internal Medicine published in April 2017 – “Studies have consistently shown that 20% - 30% of medication prescriptions are never filled, approximately 50% of medications for chronic disease are not taken as prescribed due to cost constraints.The Solution you will provide as a SingleCare Sales Representative You will help shape the future of the healthcare industry.

The company does not run EVA/EVOH layers in terms of cheese or fresh meat specialized packaging. The current capabilities do include PET laminations, coatings, converting, etc.Margin$? Mid to higher margin films. Portfolio includes commodity-based industrial films. No coverage needed for that.Sales and customer support available? Yes, multiple employees handle this specifically.THE ROLE: Why open? Company has ramped up their capabilities - need you to fill up their lines with multiple truck load orders! Also, the company is poised to introduce new food packaging capabilities such as metalized films for the chips bag, coffee and yogurt packaging markets. Join a great team - offer your technical expertise to help executives navigate the process of introducing new capabilities.Is the SE oversaturated with sales coverage? Far from it. The company will let you know a tiny handful of accounts to avoid - outside of that, you will slice and dice low hanging fruit for the first 5 years - easily. The company does not have a sales person in the SE. The current sales force only has solid coverage over industrial films (nationally). For food and medical, their current coverage is in the SW, the S (central - i.e. TX and OK, etc.), and very spotty coverage over the Midwest and SE. You can stretch out in your backyard nearly as much as you want.Size of Sale:  500lbs to multiple truck loads. Latter preferred.Inherit Accounts? Yes and no. You will (likely) be handed multiple (if not 12+) accounts that have been inactive for years. However, you will not be given a book of $10M+ to manage. The last sales person they hired from me in IL-WI area was thrilled via confidence of capitalizing low hanging fruit, as the company made a great name for itself. The former CEO of their main competitor, in fact, was bummed that his competition was so good and such a solid company with a happy and tenured salesforce (not making that up, either).Hunter vs Account Management? First year 100% hunter (including drumming up inactive accounts / low hanging fruit), then the goal would be to blend in more account management thereafter. The company successfully maintains the business goal of long-term business - as opposed to lip service to that motto.Direct Management of others? Not immediately. Potentially in near future.REQUIREMENTSDegree not requiredYou have sold plastic flexible packaging into food packaging AND/OR medical films applications for 3+ yearsYou have recently sold plastic flexible food packaging - within the last 3 years (i.e. not a stone-cold book of business)You live near a good airport for domestic flightsYou are open to a home-office position, making presence on-site at the employer 1-3 times a fiscal quarter (or so)You are comfortable with a base not exceeding $100K, assuming confidence that the commissions schedule is moderately aggressive for both existing and new business, relatively.

Marketing | San Francisco, CA, United States or Remote (North America)
VMware’s Modern Application Platforms Business Unit (MAPBU) has a bold mission—catalyze enterprise transformation through software. At the center of telling this narrative and empowering sales is product marketing.
Product marketing takes a unique combination of skills. To be a product marketer is to be savvy of technology industry dynamics and trends, a messaging expert, a constant collaborator with marketing and go-to-market teams, and a creative producer of content that cuts across product positioning to industry commentary.
Job Role and Responsibilities:
MAPBU is seeking a Product Marketer to run product marketing for a crucial area of our VMware Tanzu Labs business: the software consulting services that help our customers build, run and manage modern application platforms.
Organizations of all sizes are investing in Kubernetes and related technologies. The experts at VMware Tanzu Labs have unique capabilities to help these firms achieve better outcomes with K8s and the broader ecosystem of open-source projects. Tanzu Labs does this through custom engagements with IT leaders and practitioners looking to build and develop a modern app platform and establish modern operations practices for sustained success.
This Product Marketing role will play a critical part in our success—shaping our overarching platform services narrative, and establishing Tanzu Labs as the go-to partner for enterprises that want to adopt Kubernetes as their standard infrastructure API.
We count on Product Marketing to define messaging, drive sales enablement, understand and grow our platform services, feed campaigns, drive the agenda at industry conferences like VMworld and SpringOne, and collaborate across business units to amplify the Tanzu Labs value proposition.
This role also has the potential for greater company-wide impact, informing VMware’s perspective on business-aligned open source technology, subscription-based businesses, and engagement with new customer personas.
Responsibilities may include, but are not limited to:
Product positioning. Define the core messaging framework for owned products, socialize across stakeholders, and apply to a core set of marketing materials.
Sales enablement. Ready our sales specialists to carry our message(s) to market with consistency and confidence through annual sales kick-off sessions and ongoing training. Drive the Tanzu Labs platform services journey message for the Tanzu Labs sales specialists, MAPBU field, core VMware field, channel partners, and the broader market.
Content creation. Create external-facing content (slide decks, briefs, blogs, papers, multimedia, reference architectures, etc.) aligned to campaigns, sales needs, and competitive threats.
Required Skills & Experience:
Product Marketing. At least five (5) years of product marketing or product management experience. You'll need to have seen the full cycle of product launches and transitions to be effective.
An intermediate understanding of cloud-native technologies and practices. You'll need to be familiar with popular open-source projects and modern DevOps practices. Familiarity with Kubernetes and other CNCF projects is preferred.
Student. You don’t need to be a certified Kubernetes admin, but you’ve got to have the desire to really dig in and understand the technology and its impact in enterprises.
Organizer & communicator. You’ll need to stay on top of multiple product threads, collaborate with different business units, marketing teams, and a globally distributed base of Tanzu Labs practitioners. Demands for collateral and messaging support will compete for your time; you’ll need to ruthlessly prioritize.
Storyteller and writer. This isn’t a behind-the-scenes role; you’ll need to collaborate with stakeholders across VMware and stay in close communication with/present frequently to sales reps and sales leadership. You need to have the ability to break down complex concepts into extremely simple and clear terms for sales. Strong written communication will serve you for internal and external content.
Presentation skills. The ability to deliver clear and concise training and webinars - supplemented by clean visual materials like slide decks - is critical for this role.
Preferred Skills:
Fluent in aspects of modern IT operations. Ideally, you’ve worked in and around the Cloud Native Computing Foundation ecosystem. Familiarity with containers and modern platform operational best practices will help you quickly get up to speed on the broader VMware Labs value proposition.
Data analysis. Experience using campaign data and sales data to determine enablement priorities and to measure the effectiveness of your efforts.

ProtoCall Services,9 days ago,Atlanta,Remote Crisis Counselor,,$23.00 - $27.95 an hour,"Work from your home while making a difference at the nation’s elite telephonic behavioral health organization!

Remote Crisis Counselor Positions

In these uncertain times, ProtoCall Services, a national leader in crisis intervention, assessment and access services to the behavioral health field, has successfully migrated 100% of our workforce to working fully remote. As we continue to grow our team, our employees’ health and safety remains our top priority, and our years of experience supporting a remote workforce has allowed our staff to continue taking calls from the comfort of their homes without risking themselves or their loved ones by attempting to come to the office. Our close-knit community is used to supporting each other virtually, making this a perfect opportunity for someone eager to join a team while working remotely.


Established in 1992, ProtoCall’s customers include community behavioral health providers, employee assistance programs, university counseling centers, and managed behavioral health organizations. ProtoCall answers calls on behalf of over 400 organizations who look to our call takers to provide effective and compassionate access to services 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, as coverage that they typically could not otherwise afford.


ProtoCall Services is made up of a resilient team who work around the clock to provide immediate support for those in crisis, and are located all over the country. Think of us as mental health first aid on a paramedic scale; we are telephonic first responders to people in need. We’re looking for Master's-level counselors and social workers to provide crisis counseling services to consumers nationwide. Remote workers are highly independent and technologically savvy, with a private work space available.

At ProtoCall, you will learn how to effectively navigate emergent mental health situations with confidence as one of our crisis intervention professionals. Through our rigorous 6-week training and 6-month orientation period, you will be trained at the elite level of the nation’s leading telephonic behavioral health organization. We are ProtoCall’s Crisis Counselors.


What We Look For

You must have an MSW, PsyD, or PhD in behavioral health field or M.A. or M.S. in behavioral health with a clinical practice emphasis from a program that is accredited by COAMFTE, CACREP, or CORE.

You must be licensed (limited and full LMSW/full LPC) according to the State of Georgia licensing board requirements.

We are looking for clinicians who thrive in a fast paced environment that serves people in crisis.

Our clinicians work from a brief, solution-focused model to best assist as many of our callers as possible in a first responder model, while maintaining an unfailing commitment to quality care.

We move fast, much like paramedics or ER nurses. We need folks who are able to multitask while remaining present and attuned to callers who may be in their darkest hour, and be ready to do it again the next day.

We do all of our documentation while on and between calls. That means navigating all of our systems and entering information quickly.

Crisis is 24/7/365 and so are we. We don’t do traditional schedules. Our folks thrive working full-time (32 or 40 hours) in afternoon, evening, and overnight shifts, with one weekend day required every week. Schedules are consistent.

While working from home, to maintain HIPAA compliance and focus, we ask our clinicians to have a private office space with a door, with business internet with 10mb speeds or higher, not susceptible to frequent outages. Because our systems run through the internet, it cannot be satellite or cellular hotspots. Static IP address and business class internet is required. This job is high-tech and requires multitasking.


What does an average day look like for a Remote Crisis Counselor?

Our remote call takers operate from a private home office using our telecommuting equipment, but they are strongly connected to the call center through our technology and chat system. Crisis counselors receive calls from working professionals with anxiety, college students in distress, consumers in recovery, people with thoughts of suicide, and a myriad of other mental health-related presentations. We experience all levels of acuity - from routine counseling requests to someone who is in immediate danger. During an interaction with a client, you will learn to simultaneously speak with consumers over the phone, access information on available resources, manage documentation, collaborate with colleagues for support, and guide callers to their next step…all while talking someone through a critical moment in their life. Our crisis counselors do not carry a caseload and once the immediate work is done with that caller, follow up is arranged with our partners. You will start each new work day fresh without anything left over from the previous shift. As a remote crisis counselor, you are able to work independently, troubleshoot technology, and stay in touch with supervisors and colleagues to continue contributing to the team environment.

This work will teach you to literally talk people off of ledges, help others through job or love loss, grief, loneliness, anxiety, from callers who may be children, college-aged, or retirees. We talk with people looking for recovery options, counseling, or legal services through their EAPs. Crisis is a spectrum, but our training and intervention are thorough and leading in the field. If you want to learn crisis intervention, you have come to the right place.


Benefits

Ability to work safely from home
Full benefit program that includes medical, dental, life insurance, 401k, STD/LTD and EAP services
An accrued planned time off package that earns up to 4 weeks of vacation during your first year
Professional licensure supervision stipend available, if needed.
A team-oriented culture of leading crisis intervention specialists with a supportive supervisory team and accessible CEO
Opportunities for advancement within our unique company
Company-matched student loan repayment

Reliant Technology,14 days ago,Atlanta,Marketing Manager,,NA,"Thank you for giving this a read. If you are looking for an opportunity to lead a marketing function and have a knack for leading people and building funnels that drive qualified leads we’d love to hear from you.
Why are we hiring you? Well, at the heart of the matter, we have a problem
We need more high quality leads.
Who doesn’t, right? But what’s really behind that...
We don’t market to specific personas
We don’t have funnels with content that moves us from stranger to fan
We don’t have a solid iterative process of execution, goal setting and alignment in marketing
We don’t have a watchful eye over our platforms to analyze what’s working and what’s not
We don’t have someone that can take the ball and run with it in marketing
The good news is we realize some of these foundational elements are missing, and we are currently working with an agency to fill / outline the gaps, but ideas are nada without tactical execution, organization and proactive problem solving
Which is where you (drumroll) come in.
You’re a great fit if you find yourself nodding along to the following...
You have built funnels, campaigns and content to drive Marketing Qualified Leads (MQLs or prospects with intent to talk) using a combination of digital marketing techniques.
You enjoy leading people, establishing clarity, setting goals and doing a bit of the work. We are a small team and every person really matters to bring the plan together.
You learn markets quickly and may even come from the IT infrastructure space: servers, storage, networking and maintenance tools. You may have been an engineer, pre-sales specialist, sales rep or marketer for a company such as a Value Added Reseller (VAR), Reseller, Managed Service Provider (MSP) or software company like Solarwinds.
You can take off your functional marketing hat and think about what’s good for the team, not just you and marketing. #OneTeam
#Bold, You like to take calculated risks, try new things and balance that approach with consideration.
You’re optimism and #Joy mindset lifts people's spirits and is a bit contagious (in a good way).
If there’s a will there's a way. You have a knack for resourcefully, and realistically, figuring out a way to get things done. #CanDo
Finally, you have experience doing these sorts of things:
Organize the work, calendar and focus of the team
Team includes: SEO Analyst, Content Writer, and part-time Graphics Designer
Asana
Create funnels that move customers through the buying journey
Currently building some with the help of an agency
Write, edit, produce and oversee content that resonate with customers and prospects
You’ve got a knack for seeing the gaps in content and the story
Own the platforms that engage customers
We have a data team: SFDC, Drift, Pardot
Set and maintain goals that drive business value
Your background might include some of the following:
Marketing! (Definitely)
Experience in the IT infrastructure, IT services, VAR or MSP space (a big bonus)
Working with limited resources in 30-40 person company
Sound like a fit? We’d love to meet you!
Like most, just a few folks are in our office right now, but in normal times, our office and company culture is awesome - open, industrial feel, a great outdoor space, and collaborative team.
We are located off of Howell Mill Rd in Atlanta, GA but for the right person we will consider remote US-based candidates with authorization to work in the US, as long as you can interact and work on East Coast hours.
Salary is dependent on experience. We firmly believe that one great mind is better than 10 mediocre ones, so we’re happy to pay the best rates for the best people. You’ll report to the CEO.
Interested? Great! Send us your resume.

Enhancify,14 days ago,Atlanta,Jr. Sales Rep - Fast-Growing FinTech Startup - $70K-170K (Remote),US work authorization (Required)Bachelor's (Preferred)Sales Experience: 1 year (Preferred),"$70,000 - $170,000 a year","Please Read Carefully: Position: Junior Sales ManagerCompensation: $70-$170KCompany & Context: Enhancify is a fast-growing fintech startup with a clear mission: to help home improvement contractors (roofers, general contractors, remodelers, etc) build the American dream for themselves, their teams, and their communities.Specifically, we are disrupting the home improvement lending industry through an innovative point-of-sale tech platform that helps contractors seamlessly turn expensive projects into low monthly payments, while giving homeowners the ability to complete their dream projects and build value in their homes.The problem we solve is dealer fees. Traditionally, today’s old-school financing companies require contractors to pay a percentage of their project in exchange for financing. This results in an average loss of 20-40% of the profit margin, while rejecting many homeowners who don’t have excellent credit.We’ve built a software solution that empowers contractors to win more jobs by offering attractive payment options to homeowners, without paying dealer fees, and while being able to serve a large community of customers.Performance to Date: We launched about 30 months ago and are profitable. We have 1,500+ paying customers (unlike most startups) and are completely bootstrapped. We’ve built partnerships with top lending networks of America (Goldman Sachs, LendingClub, SoFi, etc.) as well as banks and credit unions and are currently sitting on ~$30B in capital to deploy through our platform.Our lean but scrappy team consists of experienced industry veterans in the digital credit, B2B SaaS, and enterprise-software spaces, as well as folks who are from the trades/home-services and get it. As a team, we are solving difficult problems, working hard, and successfully competing against billion-dollar publicly-traded competition.The Opportunity: We are seeking exceptional, ""A"" players to add to our core team in the form of a Junior Sales Manager.

We need the right people to help us put fuel on the fire.- This is an entry-level sales position. We are looking to mold and create closers, not hire them. We're looking for raw ingredients.- You will be cold-calling every day. If the idea of making 150 dials a day is something that makes you nervous, this is not for you.- Unlike most Junior sales positions, you will also be closing. We will mold you into someone who can not just sell, but close. You will be leading an end-to-end sales process yourself, generating opportunities, developing relationships, and generating revenue as a Closer. You will also have accountability as an individual contributor.- You will generate revenue, be evaluated by your ability to do so (and have fun while doing it)- You will be helping contractors grow their businesses. You will be their champion, relentlessly focused on providing more value and learning about the market. Aside from closing clients, you will also ensure your customers are successful over the long-term.- You will be a multi-channel sales practitioner, selling on the phone, over email, and video recordings- You will be trained and molded by a successful team. This is a difficult, challenging, ""slog-filled"" role. However, if you are successful here, you will develop a lethal skillset that will serve you well for the rest of your life.- You will get hands-on experience working in a high-paced startup environment. That means together we will make decisions, make mistakes, and make improvements.About You (Personality): - You're hungry as hell. You're extremely results oriented. You don't make excuses and find ways to get the job done, period. You have a clear and powerful reason why you need to succeed right now.- You have Grit. You can take damage day after day. Working in an early-stage company is hard. You have a demonstrated ability to slog through difficult situations where most others would quit. You won't give up because of bad days, weeks, or months. Once you have a vision in your mind, you will make it happen.- You have a relentless commitment to Excellence. You're obsessed with not just becoming the best at what you do (you love to compete and win)...but with pulling your best out of you. You can always improve. When you hit your goal, you know it's time to raise your standards.- Above all, you are Trustworthy. While you love to win, your core desire is to help people. You have an unshakeable sense of ethics. Your core values are honesty, loyalty, and integrity. You take complete responsibility when you screw up.- While you love to win, your core desire is to help people. You have an unshakeable sense of ethics and are trustworthy.

You will report to the Head of Design for Aladdin WealthTech.
You will be joining a product team with a start-up feel and a global impact. Aladdin Wealth provides wealth managers with an integrated suite of experiences for users that range from front-line financial advisors to the Chief Investment Officer at the home-office. Aladdin Wealth was born three years ago as a BlackRock hackathon project and has rapidly expanded as a product used by some of the largest wealth managers in the world.

Be a hands-on product designer for our toughest design challenges for Aladdin Wealth, while also helping designers on the team to raise their design game.
Be a partner with your peers in product management and engineering to craft a product roadmap for Aladdin Wealth, own the health of the Aladdin Wealth experience and create the environment and processes for great designs to come to life in our released products.
Be a key contributor to the definition of a design system across Aladdin Wealth, working with designers in Aladdin WealthTech and the Aladdin Product Group.

6+ years’ experience as a product designer of software applications (web, preferably)

Experience as a design lead in scrums and agile projects
Experience integrating user feedback in the design process and across multiple product releases

Learn more about FireEye's world-class solutions and global footprint at https://www.fireeye.com/company.html.

Job Description

A successful Red Team consultant at FireEye should possess a deep understanding of both information security and computer science. They should understand basic concepts such as networking, applications, and operating system functionality and be able to learn advanced concepts such as application manipulation, exploit development, and stealthy operations. This is not a “press the ‘pwn’ button” type of job; this career is technical and challenging with opportunities to work in some of the most exciting areas of security consulting on extremely technical and challenging work. A typical job could be breaking into a segmented secure zone at a Fortune 500 bank, reverse engineering an application and encryption method in order to gain access to sensitive data, all without being detected. If you can exploit at scale while remaining stealthy, identify and exploit misconfigurations in network infrastructure, parse various types of output data, present relevant data in a digestible manner, think well outside the box, or are astute enough to quickly learn these skills, then you’re the type of consultant we’re looking for.
At FireEye, you’ll be faced with complex problem solving opportunities and hands-on testing opportunities on a daily basis. We help our clients protect their most sensitive and valuable data through comprehensive and real world scenario testing. The objective doesn’t end at gaining “domain admin” or “root”; this is expected and is only a starting point.
You are expected to quickly assimilate new information as you will face new client environments on a weekly or monthly basis. You will be expected to understand all the threat vectors to each environment and properly assess them. You will get to work with some of the best red teamers in the industry, causing you to develop new skills as you progress through your career. Are you up to the challenge?
Responsibilities:
Perform network penetration, web and mobile application testing, source code reviews, threat analysis, wireless network assessments, and social-engineering assessments
Develop comprehensive and accurate reports and presentations for both technical and executive audiences
Effectively communicate findings and strategy to client stakeholders including technical staff, executive leadership, and legal counsel
Recognize and safely utilize attacker tools, tactics, and procedures
Develop scripts, tools, or methodologies to enhance FireEye Mandiant’s red teaming processes
Assist with scoping prospective engagements, leading engagements from kickoff through remediation, and mentoring less experienced staff

Qualifications

Requirements:
4-7 years' experience in at least three of the following:
Network penetration testing and manipulation of network infrastructure
Mobile and/or web application assessments
Email, phone, or physical social-engineering assessments
Shell scripting or automation of simple tasks using Perl, Python, or Ruby
Developing, extending, or modifying exploits, shellcode or exploit tools
Developing applications in C#, ASP, .NET, ObjectiveC, Go, or Java (J2EE)
Reverse engineering malware, data obfuscators, or ciphers
Source code review for control flow and security flaws
Strong knowledge of tools used for wireless, web application, and network security testing
Thorough understanding of network protocols, data on the wire, and covert channels
Mastery of Unix/Linux/Mac/Windows operating systems, including bash and Powershell
Must be eligible to work in the US without sponsorship
Additional Qualifications:
Ability to travel up to 20%
Ability to successfully interface with clients (internal and external)
Ability to document and explain technical details in a concise, understandable manner
Ability to manage and balance own time among multiple tasks, and lead junior staff when required

Hello there!
We’re Aladdin WealthTech. We are a FinTech company with a start-up vibe but some big-time resources. We are part of BlackRock, the largest asset manager on the planet … that is also a $1B annual revenue enterprise software company. We create products that help financial advisors and their clients build financial plans and portfolios to achieve some of life’s most important moments: buying a home, sending your kids to college and retirement. We believe in the power of BlackRock’s world-class portfolio analytics AND the importance of the human connection between advisor and client.
We are looking for an experienced UX/UI designer to lead design on a high-growth product area: SMA (separately managed accounts) and Model Portfolios. You may have heard about BlackRock’s acquisition of Aperio, a Bay area leader in SMAs. Our belief is that the SMA space is an area full of potential to be disrupted by world-class design, service and technology. We are looking for a designer interested in the opportunity to lead design for our product team tackling the SMA/models market.
This is a hands-on designer role: you will be a hands-on designer for some projects, partnering with product management to craft product roadmaps and define future product directions, working with engineering and product management to realize designs, working with other designers in the Aladdin WealthTech team to improve the craft and process of design @ BlackRock.
You will be joining a product team with a start-up feel and a global impact. Aladdin Wealth provides wealth managers with an integrated suite of experiences for users that range from front-line financial advisors to the Chief Investment Officer at the home-office. You will be working with some of the original pioneers of SMA and model products inside BlackRock, financial service veterans and newcomers from technology companies, large and small. We work hard, enjoy each other’s company during and after work and are passionate about the potential of our technology to improve financial outcomes for clients. We like our mash-up of finTech start-up and market-leading financial services company … and we think that you might like it, too!
Interested in learning more? Reach out to our recruiting team and let’s get to know each other!
Location: San Francisco (SoMa), Princeton (NJ), NY (Mid-town Manhattan) or Atlanta. Our teams are currently working remote through at least March 2021. We expect our future to be a hybrid office/work from home mix.
What you will be doing:
Lead product design for an emerging product family focused on SMAs + model portfolios.
Be a partner with your peers in product management and engineering to craft a product roadmap for BlackRock’s SMA and model portfolio products, own the health of the experience and create the environment and processes for great designs to come to life in our released products.
Be a hands-on designer for SMA + model portfolio projects, ranging from UX to UI design.
Be a key contributor to the definition of a design system across Aladdin Wealth, working with designers in Aladdin WealthTech and the Aladdin Product Group.
Be an expert on trends in wealth management product design … and to bring that expertise into the craft of creating Aladdin WealthTech product designs and our product roadmaps.
What we’re looking for:
6+ years’ experience as a product designer of software applications (web, preferably)
2+ years mentoring and coaching designers
Experience across multiple release cycles leading product design for a complex product; including representing design as part of a triad (design, development + product management) and coordinating the work of multiple designers
Experience as a design lead in scrums and agile projects
Experience integrating user feedback in the design process and across multiple product releases
Exceptional UX design skills combined with strong UI design skills. You are as comfortable and proficient designing experiences for complex user journeys as you are sweating the details on visual hierarchy and flow
Highly proficient in design delivery tools and workflows, including Sketch, Abstract and InVision
Exceptional communication skills with a proven ability to work down, across and up
An interest in wealth management and investing
BS/BFA degree in human-computer interaction, visual communication or a related field
A strong portfolio of creative product design solutions to complex problems
What we would prefer (think rainbow unicorns):
Prior experience creating products in the wealth management space, with a track-record of designing innovative solutions that improve business and portfolio outcomes for financial advisors and help investors achieve their financial goals
Experience working with and evolving design systems used across a product family
Experience designing products that are part of complex user journeys and working on problems that involve service design

About this role
Hello there!
We’re Aladdin WealthTech. We are a FinTech company with a start-up vibe but some big-time resources. We are part of BlackRock, the largest asset manager on the planet … that is also a $1B annual revenue enterprise software company. We create products that help financial advisors and their clients build financial plans and portfolios to achieve some of life’s most important moments: buying a home, sending your kids to college and retirement. We believe in the power of BlackRock’s world-class portfolio analytics AND the importance of the human connection between advisor and client.
We are looking for an experienced UX/UI designer to lead design on a high-growth product area: SMA (separately managed accounts) and Model Portfolios. You may have heard about BlackRock’s acquisition of Aperio, a Bay area leader in SMAs. Our belief is that the SMA space is an area full of potential to be disrupted by world-class design, service and technology. We are looking for a designer interested in the opportunity to lead design for our product team tackling the SMA/models market.
This is a hands-on designer role: you will be a hands-on designer for some projects, partnering with product management to craft product roadmaps and define future product directions, working with engineering and product management to realize designs, working with other designers in the Aladdin WealthTech team to improve the craft and process of design @ BlackRock.
You will be joining a product team with a start-up feel and a global impact. Aladdin Wealth provides wealth managers with an integrated suite of experiences for users that range from front-line financial advisors to the Chief Investment Officer at the home-office. You will be working with some of the original pioneers of SMA and model products inside BlackRock, financial service veterans and newcomers from technology companies, large and small. We work hard, enjoy each other’s company during and after work and are passionate about the potential of our technology to improve financial outcomes for clients. We like our mash-up of finTech start-up and market-leading financial services company … and we think that you might like it, too!
Interested in learning more? Reach out to our recruiting team and let’s get to know each other!
Location: San Francisco (SoMa), Princeton (NJ), NY (Mid-town Manhattan) or Atlanta. Our teams are currently working remote through at least March 2021. We expect our future to be a hybrid office/work from home mix.
What you will be doing:
Lead product design for an emerging product family focused on SMAs + model portfolios.
Be a partner with your peers in product management and engineering to craft a product roadmap for BlackRock’s SMA and model portfolio products, own the health of the experience and create the environment and processes for great designs to come to life in our released products.
Be a hands-on designer for SMA + model portfolio projects, ranging from UX to UI design.
Be a key contributor to the definition of a design system across Aladdin Wealth, working with designers in Aladdin WealthTech and the Aladdin Product Group.
Be an expert on trends in wealth management product design … and to bring that expertise into the craft of creating Aladdin WealthTech product designs and our product roadmaps.
What we’re looking for:
6+ years’ experience as a product designer of software applications (web, preferably)
2+ years mentoring and coaching designers
Experience across multiple release cycles leading product design for a complex product; including representing design as part of a triad (design, development + product management) and coordinating the work of multiple designers
Experience as a design lead in scrums and agile projects
Experience integrating user feedback in the design process and across multiple product releases
Exceptional UX design skills combined with strong UI design skills. You are as comfortable and proficient designing experiences for complex user journeys as you are sweating the details on visual hierarchy and flow
Highly proficient in design delivery tools and workflows, including Sketch, Abstract and InVision
Exceptional communication skills with a proven ability to work down, across and up
An interest in wealth management and investing
BS/BFA degree in human-computer interaction, visual communication or a related field
A strong portfolio of creative product design solutions to complex problems
What we would prefer (think rainbow unicorns):
Prior experience creating products in the wealth management space, with a track-record of designing innovative solutions that improve business and portfolio outcomes for financial advisors and help investors achieve their financial goals
Experience working with and evolving design systems used across a product family
Experience designing products that are part of complex user journeys and working on problems that involve service design
