Our Trading Experience is designed to encourage smart, ambitious, collaborative women to break the mold. We’ve heard all the myths about trading—too cutthroat, too intense, too risky and we know that’s not the case at PEAK6. Investing in women is a winning trade, and there are not enough female traders in the field yet. We are changing that.
Our Trading Experience will introduce you to the basics of trading, help you see how empowering trading can be, and help you develop key skills that you’ll leverage in any industry . You will experience a fast paced, risk-seeking environment where you're trading based on instant news (even using Twitter and TikTok to help form ideas!). What better way to give you the knowledge and exposure of being a trader than for you to experience it yourself. No prior knowledge or experience? No problem. In fact, it is welcome. For 2021, we will be hosting this program remotely.
You can expect the Trading Experience to include:

Working on an impactful project from concept to delivery, and presenting your work to senior leadership, end users, and stakeholders of the organization
Skill development in learning how to take calculated risks and decision making by executing trades and playing various risk-taking games
Watching the markets and forming opinions based on current news
Weekly poker sessions hosted by traders to tie in trading concepts
Comprehensive mentorship and feedback process that includes dedicated 1:1 mentors, scheduled feedback cycles, and weekly 360-degree feedback of the program
Learning advanced option theory and the basics of volatility trading
Collaborating with, learning from, and articulating your ideas and strategies to senior trading partners, team members, and supporting departments
Rotating with and pitching trade ideas to traders
Exposure to other PEAK6 business lines and ventures to enhance career perspective.
Multiple opportunities to hear and learn from influential women in the FinTech space,
Defined experience timeline and structured program, from start to finish to ensure a maximum experience
Company sponsored events including social, team-building, and experiential programs

You will gain loads of experience in our Trading Experience, but before you do you should have:

Junior standing (graduating between December 2021 – June 2022)
Curiosity to learn and driven to improve
Excellent written and verbal communication abilities
Demonstrated leadership ability
Ability to thrive in collaborative environments
Exceptional problem-solving skills

Due to the unprecedented situation of COVID-19, PEAK6 has decided to protect our current and future employees by managing our business remotely.

This is an exciting opportunity to build Poker Powher’s virtual clubs using your personal network, social media savviness, and innovative marketing ideas.

Enhancify,14 days ago,Chicago,Jr. Sales Rep - Fast-Growing FinTech Startup - $70K-170K (Remote),US work authorization (Required)Bachelor's (Preferred)Sales Experience: 1 year (Preferred),"$70,000 - $170,000 a year","Please Read Carefully: Position: Junior Sales ManagerCompensation: $70-$170KCompany & Context: Enhancify is a fast-growing fintech startup with a clear mission: to help home improvement contractors (roofers, general contractors, remodelers, etc) build the American dream for themselves, their teams, and their communities.Specifically, we are disrupting the home improvement lending industry through an innovative point-of-sale tech platform that helps contractors seamlessly turn expensive projects into low monthly payments, while giving homeowners the ability to complete their dream projects and build value in their homes.The problem we solve is dealer fees. Traditionally, today’s old-school financing companies require contractors to pay a percentage of their project in exchange for financing. This results in an average loss of 20-40% of the profit margin, while rejecting many homeowners who don’t have excellent credit.We’ve built a software solution that empowers contractors to win more jobs by offering attractive payment options to homeowners, without paying dealer fees, and while being able to serve a large community of customers.Performance to Date: We launched about 30 months ago and are profitable. We have 1,500+ paying customers (unlike most startups) and are completely bootstrapped. We’ve built partnerships with top lending networks of America (Goldman Sachs, LendingClub, SoFi, etc.) as well as banks and credit unions and are currently sitting on ~$30B in capital to deploy through our platform.Our lean but scrappy team consists of experienced industry veterans in the digital credit, B2B SaaS, and enterprise-software spaces, as well as folks who are from the trades/home-services and get it. As a team, we are solving difficult problems, working hard, and successfully competing against billion-dollar publicly-traded competition.The Opportunity: We are seeking exceptional, ""A"" players to add to our core team in the form of a Junior Sales Manager.

We need the right people to help us put fuel on the fire.- This is an entry-level sales position. We are looking to mold and create closers, not hire them. We're looking for raw ingredients.- You will be cold-calling every day. If the idea of making 150 dials a day is something that makes you nervous, this is not for you.- Unlike most Junior sales positions, you will also be closing. We will mold you into someone who can not just sell, but close. You will be leading an end-to-end sales process yourself, generating opportunities, developing relationships, and generating revenue as a Closer. You will also have accountability as an individual contributor.- You will generate revenue, be evaluated by your ability to do so (and have fun while doing it)- You will be helping contractors grow their businesses. You will be their champion, relentlessly focused on providing more value and learning about the market.

This is a difficult, challenging, ""slog-filled"" role. However, if you are successful here, you will develop a lethal skillset that will serve you well for the rest of your life.- You will get hands-on experience working in a high-paced startup environment. That means together we will make decisions, make mistakes, and make improvements.About You (Personality): - You're hungry as hell. You're extremely results oriented. You don't make excuses and find ways to get the job done, period. You have a clear and powerful reason why you need to succeed right now.- You have Grit. You can take damage day after day. Working in an early-stage company is hard. You have a demonstrated ability to slog through difficult situations where most others would quit. You won't give up because of bad days, weeks, or months. Once you have a vision in your mind, you will make it happen.- You have a relentless commitment to Excellence. You're obsessed with not just becoming the best at what you do (you love to compete and win)...but with pulling your best out of you. You can always improve. When you hit your goal, you know it's time to raise your standards.- Above all, you are Trustworthy. While you love to win, your core desire is to help people. You have an unshakeable sense of ethics. Your core values are honesty, loyalty, and integrity. You take complete responsibility when you screw up.- While you love to win, your core desire is to help people. You have an unshakeable sense of ethics and are trustworthy.

Our Take on Leadership:
Growth Mindset: This is competitive leadership. Taking the lead in the market place versus following. It's a positive attitude about the company's future — glass half-full —but it's realistic. It's passion for winning. Winning defined as gaining market share. It's placing a fresh emphasis on innovation — challenging the status quo.
Consumer and Customer Focus: This is purpose-driven leadership. It's externally focused — on consumers, on customers. First take care of consumers and customers; financial performance will follow. It's a heightened passion for the consumer: “I firmly believe in improving the lives of consumers.” It's bringing the voice of the consumer and the customer into everything we do. It's seeing our brands through their eyes.
Bias for action: This is action-driven leadership: ""This is what I will do."" It's speed and sense of urgency in making decisions. But it needs to be thoughtful action, intelligent risk-taking. Also, it's not wasting time on bureaucracy — it’s output that counts. And it’s simplifying my agenda, carefully choosing priorities — and not taking on too much.
Accountability and Responsibility: This is performance-driven leadership. ""I will deliver against KPIs, holding myself to the highest standards.” I will also hold other people accountable — first by setting clear expectations and then by telling them if they are on the right path. It's staring reality in the eye — doing it with numbers. It's taking responsibility for Unilever's overall performance, not just by delivering my results but by helping other people deliver their results. Finally, it’s personally driving change and using operational discipline to deliver on the promise.
Building Talent and Teams: This is people-driven leadership. It's passion for people. It's having the best people in the right positions, whatever the person's gender or background. It's giving people plenty of room to do their part, and recognizing them for their contributions. It's investing in people's development — giving them feedback and challenging work. It’s also constantly challenging myself to grow and improve. And it's building aligned, cohesive teams that pull together to win."

In these surveys, Crowe personnel attribute the following policies to making Crowe a great place to work:

Innovation: Each year, Crowe invests about two percent of firm revenue in new product development funding to develop ideas brought forward by its people.

This policy continues to receive great reviews on annual internal employee engagement surveys.

Benefits: The firm promotes healthy living through its internal well-being portal, which allows Crowe individuals to complete wellness activities – such as exercise challenges, healthy eating, doctor visits and mindful lifestyle changes – for gift cards and health insurance premium reductions. Additionally, on top of its healthcare and retirement programs, Crowe recently expanded its paid time off policies for military leave and all new parents.

Community service: Recently acknowledged in the Fortune Best Workplaces for Giving Back list, the firm places a high priority on community service. In honor of the firm’s 75th year, Crowe personnel not only achieved, but surpassed their goal of 75,000 hours of volunteering. We're proud to announce that we volunteered 82,000 hours – giving back to the communities where we live and work. That’s the equivalent of 39 full-time employees at the nonprofits we served!

The IOP also sponsors a robust, paid internship program for undergraduate and graduate students, placing them in high-level settings overseas, in Washington, D.C. and at the state and local levels.

Who We Are

Independent for over 70 years, Milliman delivers market-leading services and solutions to clients worldwide. Today, we are helping companies take on some of the world’s most critical and complex issues, including retirement funding and healthcare financing, risk management and regulatory compliance, data analytics and business transformation.

Milliman is one of the world’s largest independent consulting and actuarial firms. We deliver market-leading services and solutions to our clients. Through a team of professionals ranging from actuaries to clinicians, technology specialists to plan administrators, we offer unparalleled expertise in healthcare, employee benefits, investment consulting, life insurance and financial services, and property and casualty insurance. Voted one of the top 10 U.S. consulting firms to work for, Milliman brings depth, clarity and context to the issues and challenges our clients face every day.

Role

Milliman is one of the leading experts in healthcare financing and delivery. We advise clients on a wide range of issues—from assessing the impact of healthcare reform on organizations or populations to streamlining operations while advancing the quality of patient care. Our consulting work is supported by a powerful toolkit of data analytics solutions and informed by the most trusted, comprehensive set of cost guidelines in the industry.

Associate Actuaries perform data analysis using Excel, SAS, and proprietary Milliman programs to assist with consulting for various health insurance work areas, such as Medicare, Commercial / ACA, Medicaid, Long Term Care, Pharmacy, and more.

Managers typically work on five to seven projects simultaneously and are expected to add insight into the technical direction of a project, check the initial reasonableness of the solution and create client communications for review by Consultants. Client interaction generally includes data collection, project updates and answering basic technical questions.

Within a project team, consultants, Associate Actuaries/Managers, and analysts coordinate their efforts to deliver client reports and deliverables. Consultants are responsible for building relationships with clients, directing projects, and presenting results. Associate Actuary Managers work directly with analysts and junior ASAs by reviewing work, answering questions, and developing client correspondence.

Better Government Association,27 days ago,Chicago,INVESTIGATIVE INTERNSHIP,,"$1,000 a month","The Better Government Association — a nonprofit, nonpartisan organization focused on government accountability in Illinois — is launching a new internship program and seeking applicants for two paid internships with the BGA’s investigative reporting team, beginning in June of 2021.
The two positions are part time (20 hours per week) and will pay stipends of $6,000 ($1,000 per month) each for six months. If there isn’t a stay-at-home order due to the pandemic, interns will work out of the BGA’s offices in downtown Chicago and alongside BGA reporters. But when the BGA staff is working remotely, so will interns. Previous BGA interns have worked on investigative projects from beginning to end, spending months scouring, organizing and cleaning governmental databases, creating data visuals, conducting reporting, writing memos, helping draft stories and earning bylines.
About Us
Established in 1923, the BGA is one of the nation’s oldest nonprofit newsrooms. We focus on transparency, efficiency and accountability in government in Chicago and across Illinois. Our work appears on our website as well as online, in print and on television with journalistic partners. In recent years, the BGA has partnered with scores of news organizations throughout Illinois, including WBEZ (NPR’s affiliate in Chicago), the Chicago Sun-Times, NBC-5 Chicago and Crain’s Chicago Business. We are also the Illinois franchisee for PolitiFact.
Recent BGA investigations have focused on:
An examination of coronavirus spending by Chicago Public Schools that launched an internal investigation
An unprecedented investigation into the Cook County Court system and judges, including a massive datavisual breakdown of historical data
Years of mismanagement and scandal at O’Hare International Airport
Chicago’s dubious recycling program
A look at environmental enforcement in Chicago under Rahm Emanuel (This story was done with the assistance of interns.)
How suburban police escape discipline for shootings
An examination of suburban poverty through the lens of one small town
About The Work
The BGA is committed to providing a positive and productive learning experience for investigative interns. While the responsibilities of interns will depend on the needs of the investigative team, assigned tasks may include:
Working directly with reporters on long-term projects and ideas
Writing PolitiFact fact-checks of statements made by public officials
Traveling to courthouses to pull records
Filing Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests
Developing sources
Outreach, interviews and fact checking with subjects of stories
Attending news conferences
Amassing and crunching data and helping with graphics
Drafting memos for reporters and contributing to story drafts
Working with media partners and being given an opportunity to observe and participate in media collaboration
About The Program
This internship has a flexible start date. Each intern will be expected to devote a minimum of 20 hours per week to the program. This commitment will lead to an opportunity for bylines on major projects alongside BGA staff reporters.
The BGA is committed to diversity and inclusion and strongly encourages applicants of color, LGBTQ, women, people with disabilities, formerly incarcerated people, and/or those from immigrant backgrounds to apply for this internship. This internship includes a monthly stipend of $1,000 for the six month period.
Interns will work closely with BGA investigative staff and will receive a minimum of one hour of direct supervision from editors each week, plus several hours of direct management from BGA reporters. The cohort will have full access to BGA supplies, materials and investigative resources.
This internship program began in 2020 and is the result of a generous gift from David Jackson, a former investigative reporter at the Chicago Tribune who joined the BGA in August. A four-time Pulitzer Prize finalist and one-time Pulitzer winner, Jackson established the Gary Marx Journalism Fund to honor Chicago investigative reporter Gary Marx, a longtime reporting partner who still works at the Chicago Tribune. Marx began his career as a war correspondent in Africa, uncovered human rights abuses in Latin America and then returned to Chicago to expose prison murders, local political corruption and sexual violence against public school students. Jackson said the goal of the fund is to inspire a new generation of investigative reporters.
Throughout their time with the BGA, the interns will be given the opportunity to meet with the program’s supporters to discuss their experience.
Deadline
To qualify for the internships that begins in June 2021, applications must be received by Friday, March 5, 2021. Applicants can either be enrolled in an undergraduate or graduate degree program. Spring 2021 graduates will also be considered. Applicants not enrolled in higher education programs or those who do not have a college degree are also encouraged to apply.
Apply

FireEye is the intelligence-led security company. Working as a seamless, scalable extension of customer security operations, FireEye offers a single platform that blends innovative security technologies, nation-state grade threat intelligence, and world-renowned Mandiant® consulting. With this approach, FireEye eliminates the complexity and burden of cyber security for organizations struggling to prepare for, prevent, and respond to cyber attacks. FireEye has over 9,000 customers across 103 countries, including more than 50 percent of the Forbes Global 2000.

Job Description

A successful Red Team consultant at FireEye should possess a deep understanding of both information security and computer science. They should understand basic concepts such as networking, applications, and operating system functionality and be able to learn advanced concepts such as application manipulation, exploit development, and stealthy operations. This is not a “press the ‘pwn’ button” type of job; this career is technical and challenging with opportunities to work in some of the most exciting areas of security consulting on extremely technical and challenging work. A typical job could be breaking into a segmented secure zone at a Fortune 500 bank, reverse engineering an application and encryption method in order to gain access to sensitive data, all without being detected. If you can exploit at scale while remaining stealthy, identify and exploit misconfigurations in network infrastructure, parse various types of output data, present relevant data in a digestible manner, think well outside the box, or are astute enough to quickly learn these skills, then you’re the type of consultant we’re looking for.
At FireEye, you’ll be faced with complex problem solving opportunities and hands-on testing opportunities on a daily basis. We help our clients protect their most sensitive and valuable data through comprehensive and real world scenario testing. The objective doesn’t end at gaining “domain admin” or “root”; this is expected and is only a starting point.
You are expected to quickly assimilate new information as you will face new client environments on a weekly or monthly basis. You will be expected to understand all the threat vectors to each environment and properly assess them. You will get to work with some of the best red teamers in the industry, causing you to develop new skills as you progress through your career. Are you up to the challenge?
Responsibilities:
Perform network penetration, web and mobile application testing, source code reviews, threat analysis, wireless network assessments, and social-engineering assessments
Develop comprehensive and accurate reports and presentations for both technical and executive audiences
Effectively communicate findings and strategy to client stakeholders including technical staff, executive leadership, and legal counsel
Recognize and safely utilize attacker tools, tactics, and procedures
Develop scripts, tools, or methodologies to enhance FireEye Mandiant’s red teaming processes
Assist with scoping prospective engagements, leading engagements from kickoff through remediation, and mentoring less experienced staff

Qualifications

Requirements:
4-7 years' experience in at least three of the following:
Network penetration testing and manipulation of network infrastructure
Mobile and/or web application assessments
Email, phone, or physical social-engineering assessments
Shell scripting or automation of simple tasks using Perl, Python, or Ruby
Developing, extending, or modifying exploits, shellcode or exploit tools
Developing applications in C#, ASP, .NET, ObjectiveC, Go, or Java (J2EE)
Reverse engineering malware, data obfuscators, or ciphers
Source code review for control flow and security flaws
Strong knowledge of tools used for wireless, web application, and network security testing
Thorough understanding of network protocols, data on the wire, and covert channels
Mastery of Unix/Linux/Mac/Windows operating systems, including bash and Powershell
Must be eligible to work in the US without sponsorship
Additional Qualifications:
Ability to travel up to 20%
Ability to successfully interface with clients (internal and external)
Ability to document and explain technical details in a concise, understandable manner
Ability to manage and balance own time among multiple tasks, and lead junior staff when required
