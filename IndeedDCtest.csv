"Cambridge Computer Services, Inc",4 days ago,DC,Enterprise Technology Account Executive SLED,,NA,"The High Level

What if you had the best technical experts in data storage, data protection, security, HPC, and networking offering decades of expertise at no cost to your clients? And what if that enabled you to sell high caliber technology solutions to your clients for their physical, virtual, and cloud infrastructure?

Welcome to Cambridge Computer.

We have a unique business model. We are both technology consultants and technology brokers. We introduce the hottest new technologies to market and we have long-established relationships with all the major IT manufacturers in our industry. Our access enables you to solve client challenges with flagship vendors as well as the up and comers and intelligently compare and contrast those methodologies. Imagine being able to be the only place a client needs to go, never running out of ideas to solve a problem? Yes, we think that’s pretty darn cool too.


Where Do You Fit In?

To capitalize on our momentum, we're looking for an Account Executive who has successfully sold IT solutions to commercial, SLED, or federal clients so you could focus on any of the three.
Cambridge Computer holds MEEC and VASCUPP contracts, which are huge assets you can leverage to access SLED clients throughout Maryland and Virginia. You will be based out of your home office in Virginia, where you will have access to an experienced Technical Team, including local pre-sales Solution Architects (similar to systems engineers or sales engineers), as well as an Inside Sales Team, to assist and support your sales efforts. You will also be supported by our Waltham-based Professional Services, Operations, Legal, and Management Teams, all committed to empowering your growth and success.
The solutions we provide generally include hardware, software, and professional services. Our professional services are our crown jewel and not just a checkbox or afterthought - we handle everything from very small, couple day engagements to very large, couple hundred day integration/consulting projects.


In short, working at Cambridge Computer represents an unparalleled opportunity. We are the ultimate brokers in a highly lucrative space, where if you have client relationships, you can move from simply selling 1 or 2 products to a full range of solutions. You can achieve high close rates as each sale is customized to your clients individual needs. We have a host of technical talent available with years of experience who can help design and implement these solutions.

Want to succeed in sales without having that success lead to ever-increasing quotas? Want to work in an organization whose flat structure makes things simple and agile? Looking to break the traditional sales mold and truly serve your clients?

If yes to any of the above, consider this; Cambridge Computer has been in business for 30 years. We are staffed with personnel who on average have been with the company 10+ years. If you make the cut, you would join a group of people who are committed to a cause and not a paycheck. The level of resources and the easy access to them is a unique experience for those who join us. We are a team composed of the best the industry has to offer.

If you think you have what it takes to succeed, read on.

If you know you will do what it takes to succeed, apply.

Foreign & Commonwealth Office,2 days ago,DC,Congressional Advisor (Trade & Climate Change),,"$85,686 a year","Job Description (Roles and Responsibilities)
Main purpose of job:
The British Embassy is looking for a driven individual to join our Political Section as a Congressional Adviser. The two major issue areas covered by this position are Trade and Climate Change, but the successful applicant will also advise a range of colleagues, up to and including the Ambassador, on Energy, Transport, Science and Innovation, as well as helping to chart the Embassy’s wider political strategy on the Hill.
Roles and responsibilities / what will the jobholder be expected to achieve?
The Mission

With the ultimate goal of preserving and extending the UK-US Special Relationship, the British Embassy seeks to be one of the most dynamic and influential foreign missions in Washington, D.C. An active Congressional engagement strategy, spearheaded by the Ambassador, is a critical part of this agenda.

The Role


The Embassy’s Congressional Team sits within its Political Section and comprises four Congressional Advisers. Each Adviser serves as the principal point of contact on Congressional matters to the one of more of the Embassy’s policy teams. This role advises two sections: Global Issues (Energy, Climate Change, Transport, Science and Innovation) and Economic & Trade (Economic and Social Policy, G7, Trade and Agriculture). Other Advisers focus on Foreign and Security Policy and Defence.


The core function of the role is to advise these teams on Congressional strategy, identifying where UK Government policy priorities are likely to require Congressional buy-in; helping to craft engagement plans to achieve this; and spotting items on Congress’ agenda that are likely to be of relevance (both as opportunities and risks) to UK interests. The Congressional Advisers also support the work of the wider Political Section, e.g. in reporting on elections and broader political dynamics.


The Candidate Profile

To achieve this, the successful candidate will need to have:
A rich understanding of the relevant Congressional committees of jurisdiction and the legislative process;
A background in relevant policy issues (at least one of trade/economics/climate/energy);
A keen understanding of party/political dynamics;
An existing network of contacts in Hill offices and committees, gained from working on Capitol Hill, an NGO, or a lobbying firm; and
Demonstrated experience in tracking legislation and Hill activity in order to identify upcoming threats and opportunities.
Beyond these core skills, the successful candidate will need to demonstrate their capacity to be a credible interlocutor for a range of senior stakeholders, including the Ambassador (who the job-holder will staff in relevant Hill meetings) and visiting UK Government Officials, including Ministers (Chancellor, Secretary of State for International Trade, Business and Energy Minister, COP President, G7 Sherpa etc). Given the access the role grants at this level, the Adviser will need to demonstrate poise when working with senior officials, feel comfortable engaging Members of Congress, communicate clearly and persuasively, and be vigilant in staying on top of current political and legislative events.
Writing reports and official diplomatic telegrams (cables) to officials in London is a central part of the Congressional Adviser’s daily work. The written work of the Political Section in DC is some of the most read in the entire Foreign Office, often by senior readers at the highest levels, so the successful applicant must be able to write about events, policy and legislation analytically, accurately and quickly. When the post-holder is required to make the case for a particular course of action to a senior official, they must be able to make a clear argument, support it with relevant evidence, and draw well founded conclusions.
The Political Section is a tight-knit group that works together in a fast-paced environment. The ideal candidate will be someone who thrives in a team; enjoys working with others; sees opportunity in collaborating with new individuals across the Embassy and UK Government, and will be willing to support team members to advance our common goal of promoting UK priorities and managing potential legislative and political risks. Individual officers have a good degree of autonomy, but the successful candidate will need to have experience of and be comfortable with working in a hierarchy, which will include supporting on the basics of Hill engagement (e.g. assisting in setting up meetings for Ministerial visits) and covering for other team members where necessary.
Resources managed (staff and expenditure):
No staff. No expenditure.

Essential qualifications, skills and experience
Minimum of a Bachelor’s Degree required
Three to five years of relevant experience, including recent experience working on the Hill
Demonstrated expertise in at least one of the following fields: Trade, Economics, Climate, Energy
Must be able to represent the Embassy at external meetings and win the confidence of senior US and UK officials and other stakeholders
Strong knowledge of the US political system and key figures within the Congressional environment
Flexibility in a team setting, with an enthusiastic approach to work
Ability to work independently and a proven track record of showing initiative and delivering results
Strong networking skills and ability to gain access to key figures
Excellent oral communicating and drafting skills and an ability to explain complicated policy issues in a succinct manner for a non-specialist audience in the UK
Ability to travel (as external circumstances allow)
Desirable qualifications, skills and experience

Venafi is the inventor of the technology that secures and protects keys and certificates. Venafi protects machine identity types by orchestrating cryptographic keys and digital certificates for SSL/TLS, IoT, mobile, and SSH. Many of the largest organizations in the world use Venafi.

Billions of dollars have been spent protecting usernames and passwords and almost nothing protecting keys and certificates—organizations are just now realizing that protecting keys and certificates is as important as protecting usernames and passwords. The bad guys know this and are using stolen or forged keys and certificates to attack networks and steal data. In fact, Gartner says 50% of network attacks will use certificates.

Our business relationships include Peet's Coffee, American University, and Medstar Georgetown University Hospital. Wellfound Foods partners with other businesses to offer local made, high-quality meals and snacks for early risers, mid-day munchers, and late-night workers.

Our healthy and delicious products are available for wholesale and via our SmartFridges.
Healthy, affordable, and delicious grab-n-go food is the purpose that drives our work at Wellfound Foods. Both the value of the product and the value of the service is baked into how our company operates.

In addition to stocking the SmartFridges, Wellfound Foods also tracks and analyzes sales data to make sure that customers are getting the optimal amount and type of products. The SmartFridges are a turnkey food service solution that allows businesses and locations to a chance to improve their value without taking time from their normal day-to-day operations.
Board Member's Impact Potential
We are seeking to bring on a corporate board advisor to assist with the execution of our pivot from a primarily B2B sales model. In order to successfully execute our shift to a consumer sales model, we will need an advisor that can offer insight in the areas of branding and marketing. A board advisor will also need to be familiar with recent technology trends and the food industry. We consider cross-industry experience between these different areas ideal.
Brand development and recognition is a key need for the company as we move into a retail space. New advisors should expect to participate in defining marketing strategy and content creation goals and suggesting ways to maximize the impact of social media accounts.
What Can Be Accomplished
Starting in December of 2019, Wellfound Foods embarked on a shift in our business strategy. This pivot placed more emphasis on growing our consumer sales channel through the expansion of pour SmartFridges. Our SmartFridges offer a scalable consumer sales channel. We are currently raising money to fund an additional twenty machines. Our need for this pivot has been further underscored by the COVID-19 pandemic. Traditional wholesale venues have seen a decrease in traffic, while there is a higher demand for contactless food services. Now we're hoping to build Wellfound Foods as a food services thought leader in a post-COVID world.
We're looking for a board advisor to help Wellfound Foods navigate the changing business atmosphere and embark on a scalable sales trajectory. Our team values hardworking, candid problem solvers who are willing to go the extra mile to get the job done. We want a board advisor who can help plan and execute short-term and long-term goals, make valuable connections with investors and/or customers, and use their prior work experience to identify recruitment needs for the company.
Who You'll Be Working With
CEO and Founder Sarah Frimpong has a strong passion for entrepreneurship and food. After earning her degree in Economics and English she worked for the Obama campaign and in corporate sales, but she always knew that she wanted to start her own company. So, when the opportunity came for her to learn the food business from the ground up, she jumped at the chance. Wellfound Foods is the result of her years of hard work, her commitment to quality food options, and her operational leadership. A true hustler, she is constantly looking to improve the efficiency of the business and capitalize on new areas of growth.

At least 3 of the 24 semester hours must have been in calculus. (TRANSCRIPTS REQUIRED)

Evaluation of Education: The primary requirement of operations research work is competence in the rigorous methods of scientific inquiry and analysis rather than in the subject matter of the problem.

We are working to address critical challenges that the world must overcome this decade in order to secure a sustainable future for people and the planet: climate change, energy, food, forests, water, sustainable cities, and the ocean.
Internships at WRI are learning experiences designed for current students, recent graduates, or other candidates who wish to gain knowledge about a specific area of our work. We strive to attract diverse, intellectually-driven candidates who have a passion for sustainability and development.

Natural Infrastructure Initiative Overview
The WRI Natural Infrastructure Initiative (NII) empowers governments, businesses, utilities, and communities to enhance water security by investing in “natural infrastructure,” like forests and wetlands, to provide essential services like clean and abundant water supply, aquifer recharge and flood control. The Initiative increases investment in nature-based solutions (NBS) to address water security, disaster and operations risk reduction, watershed health, and climate and community resiliency. By engaging watershed stakeholders, water sector managers, policy makers, community organizations, and investors, we pioneer pathways to integrate green and gray infrastructure systems to achieve lower-cost, more resilient, and higher quality service provision and healthier communities. We advise on NBS strategies across multiple scales, from individual infrastructure facilities to entire cities and watersheds.
Internship Summary
This internship will support Natural Infrastructure work on two current efforts, the Joint Benefits Authority and the Framework for Nature-based Solutions to Advance Urban Water Resilience.
WRI is partnering with Encourage Capital (a private equity firm) and the San Francisco Public Utility Commission to develop and pilot the Joint Benefits Authority tool, a new mechanism that capitalizes on the shared benefits of integrated infrastructure by quantifying the range of benefits that cross city agency mandates. The goal is to build resilient public infrastructure that strengthens communities, particularly those in underserved and environmental justice areas, by capturing co-benefits inherent in integrated solutions.
WRI is testing a rapid planning process and developing a guidance document to help cities think through how to select and design NBS solutions to address the multiple water and heat risks while making the best use of the limited resources. This approach will help cities systematically (1) assess their heat and water risks and map their natural, human and built assets, (2) assess and select the NBS types most suitable for their geographic and built context and most effective to mitigate their risks and address their needs, and (3) identify preliminary costing and financing assessment based on resources available and potential funding opportunities to explore. This process will be tested in multiple cities in Africa with the guidance document will allow replication in cities across the globe.
The intern will work closely with WRI experts to support the development of these projects to advance natural infrastructure and water resilience for cities. The intern will contribute research, data analysis, writing and presentation development to further the JBA and Urban NBS Framework projects, along with the larger NII program goals for developing knowledge materials, investment strategies and collaboration for resilient natural infrastructure solutions for cities.
Learning Outcomes
Build knowledge in urban water management, green infrastructure, and integrated resilient infrastructure solutions.
Learn suite of innovative governance and finance tools for urban resilience.
Develop skills in research, writing, and project management.
The intern will gain experience in the following areas:
Supporting cities in pursuing joint benefit infrastructure projects with multiple partners that address climate impacts by scaling nature-based solutions. Research to support decision-making on project development and preparation of briefs and other materials to share knowledge.
Learning about the value of nature-based solutions, the multi-benefits that different technologies provide, feasibility characteristics, and associated costs. Supporting the development of a framework to help cities identify and pursue nature-based solutions for water resilience.
Developing communications and engagement skills, and applying them to support project planning, including coauthoring a blog or blog series and development of outreach materials.

Job Benefits

At Gainsight, we don't believe in doing things as a ""means to an end."" Life's too short to have anything short of a joyful work environment that we passionately believe in. We think that ""work vs. life"" is a false choice created by pundits, cynics and consultants. We also believe that any community (like a company) needs a ton of diversity and a very small number of things that bring us together.

Golden Rule: We try to practice the Golden Rule (""Do unto others..."" and that sort of thing) by exercising reliability, trust and giving back to each other and our community.
Success for All: We believe that success for our stakeholders—whether our teammates, clients or shareholders—comes with a sincere focus on continuous learning, selfless teaching and making a difference in each other's lives.
Child-like Joy: We aspire to experience child-like joy in our work and lives, injecting a spirit of passion, optimism and laughter into everything that we do.
Shoshin: We believe in a beginner's mind. Don't surround yourself with people like you-diversity breeds creativity.
Stay Thirsty, My Friends: We believe in a totally internally-driven strive for greatness. The solution is think more, not doing more.

Why You'll Love It Here

Our Attitude: We've created a new industry from scratch, and we're on the fast track!
Our Leadership: We offer the leading tech solution for driving Customer Success.
Our ROI: Reduce customer churn, increase up-sell, and improve customer satisfaction.
Our Technology: Deep Salesforce.com hooks, predictive analytics, and a beautiful user interface.
Our Impact: We help our customers make millions of dollars more per year.
Our Clients: Big companies like Box, Adobe, Marketo, and many others.
Our Team: Tech all-stars from Facebook, Box, and others (and top consulting firms like BCG and McKinsey!).
Our Values: They are unique - Golden Rule, Success for All, Child-like Joy, Shoshin, and Stay Thirsty, My Friends.
Our Office: If you showed up one day, you might find anything from karaoke performances to mini-golf championships.

Health benefits include medical, dental, vision, short and long term disability, life insurance, 401k after first quarter of employment, and flexible PTO.

VMware,9 days ago,DC,"Product Marketing Manager- Tanzu Labs - Opportunity for Working Remotely Washington, D.C.",,NA,"Product Marketing Manager - VMware Tanzu Labs
Marketing | San Francisco, CA, United States or Remote (North America)
VMware’s Modern Application Platforms Business Unit (MAPBU) has a bold mission—catalyze enterprise transformation through software. At the center of telling this narrative and empowering sales is product marketing.
Product marketing takes a unique combination of skills. To be a product marketer is to be savvy of technology industry dynamics and trends, a messaging expert, a constant collaborator with marketing and go-to-market teams, and a creative producer of content that cuts across product positioning to industry commentary.
Job Role and Responsibilities:
MAPBU is seeking a Product Marketer to run product marketing for a crucial area of our VMware Tanzu Labs business: the software consulting services that help our customers build, run and manage modern application platforms.
Organizations of all sizes are investing in Kubernetes and related technologies. The experts at VMware Tanzu Labs have unique capabilities to help these firms achieve better outcomes with K8s and the broader ecosystem of open-source projects. Tanzu Labs does this through custom engagements with IT leaders and practitioners looking to build and develop a modern app platform and establish modern operations practices for sustained success.
This Product Marketing role will play a critical part in our success—shaping our overarching platform services narrative, and establishing Tanzu Labs as the go-to partner for enterprises that want to adopt Kubernetes as their standard infrastructure API.
We count on Product Marketing to define messaging, drive sales enablement, understand and grow our platform services, feed campaigns, drive the agenda at industry conferences like VMworld and SpringOne, and collaborate across business units to amplify the Tanzu Labs value proposition.
This role also has the potential for greater company-wide impact, informing VMware’s perspective on business-aligned open source technology, subscription-based businesses, and engagement with new customer personas.
Responsibilities may include, but are not limited to:
Product positioning. Define the core messaging framework for owned products, socialize across stakeholders, and apply to a core set of marketing materials.
Sales enablement. Ready our sales specialists to carry our message(s) to market with consistency and confidence through annual sales kick-off sessions and ongoing training. Drive the Tanzu Labs platform services journey message for the Tanzu Labs sales specialists, MAPBU field, core VMware field, channel partners, and the broader market.
Content creation. Create external-facing content (slide decks, briefs, blogs, papers, multimedia, reference architectures, etc.) aligned to campaigns, sales needs, and competitive threats.
Required Skills & Experience:
Product Marketing. At least five (5) years of product marketing or product management experience. You'll need to have seen the full cycle of product launches and transitions to be effective.
An intermediate understanding of cloud-native technologies and practices. You'll need to be familiar with popular open-source projects and modern DevOps practices. Familiarity with Kubernetes and other CNCF projects is preferred.
Student. You don’t need to be a certified Kubernetes admin, but you’ve got to have the desire to really dig in and understand the technology and its impact in enterprises.
Organizer & communicator. You’ll need to stay on top of multiple product threads, collaborate with different business units, marketing teams, and a globally distributed base of Tanzu Labs practitioners. Demands for collateral and messaging support will compete for your time; you’ll need to ruthlessly prioritize.
Storyteller and writer. This isn’t a behind-the-scenes role; you’ll need to collaborate with stakeholders across VMware and stay in close communication with/present frequently to sales reps and sales leadership. You need to have the ability to break down complex concepts into extremely simple and clear terms for sales. Strong written communication will serve you for internal and external content.
Presentation skills. The ability to deliver clear and concise training and webinars - supplemented by clean visual materials like slide decks - is critical for this role.
Preferred Skills:
Fluent in aspects of modern IT operations. Ideally, you’ve worked in and around the Cloud Native Computing Foundation ecosystem. Familiarity with containers and modern platform operational best practices will help you quickly get up to speed on the broader VMware Labs value proposition.
Data analysis. Experience using campaign data and sales data to determine enablement priorities and to measure the effectiveness of your efforts.

We’re part of Friends of the Earth International, a federation of groups working in more than 70 countries on today’s most urgent environmental and social issues.


To accomplish our mission, Friends of the Earth is working at the nexus of environmental protection, economic policy and social justice to fundamentally transform the way our country and the world value people and the environment.

This work is carried out by our team of staff in our Berkeley, California and Washington, D.C. offices.


Friends of the Earth’s Food and Agriculture program works to rapidly transition our food system to one that is regenerative, healthy, and just.

Supervise and manage interns and consultants as needed.

Organizing

Support online and offline organizing of Friends of the Earth’s base to support campaign objectives.
Coordinate and organize events and actions such as rallies, petition deliveries, panel discussions, and weeks of action.

We are The Motley Fool, a purpose-driven financial services firm with nearly 30 years of expertise. Our goal is to make the world smarter, happier, and richer by providing outstanding business and investing advice, at scale. But what does that even mean?! It means we’re helping Fools (always with a capital “F”) demystify the world of finance, beat the stock market, and achieve personal wealth and happiness through our investing services, like Stock Advisor and Motley Fool Wealth Management, our portfolio management service.
What does this team do?
The Motley Fool Foundation is a NEW public charity created in January 2020 to coordinate and expand the philanthropic (or, Foolanthropic, if you will!) goals and activities of The Motley Fool. Foolanthropy has been core to the Fool since the days of dial-up internet and boy bands with frosted tips. (That would be 1997, when we launched The Motley Fool Charity Fund, the Internet's first ever group-giving campaign!) Since then, we’ve raised millions of dollars for charity, coordinated thousands of employee volunteer hours, and pioneered Fool School, teaching personal finance and investing basics to the next generation of Fools. Now, The Motley Fool Foundation’s focus is on leveraging our access and relationships in the global investing community to unlock financial freedom for all.
What would you do in this role?
As our Programming and Board Relations Intern, you will have a front-row seat as we outline and implement programs that directly affect the people we serve. You will help us develop our first pilot programs, and collect, organize, and summarize feedback and suggestions from all of our stakeholders. You will also play a valuable role supporting the work of our Board, implementing leading-edge organizational governance processes, and facilitating Board member participation in influence strategies, external communications, and fundraising efforts.
This is a paid, part time (20 hrs/wk) internship from January - May, 2021, that may be partially in-office or fully remote, depending on what the world looks like this spring! Our office is just outside Washington, DC, in Alexandria, VA.
But what does this role actually do?
Delve into the world of financial empowerment to uncover best practices and areas of opportunity for the Foundation’s programs and impact
Identify and develop relationships for prospective strategic partnerships, including corporations, foundations, and individuals
Provide dynamic support for all Board of Director activities, including managing communication and planning and executing Board meetings
Assist with project management to implement our programming and partnership strategies - scheduling meetings, tracking milestones, and doing data entry
What do you need to apply?
On the ground experience with volunteer organizing and direct service programs
Interest in a broad set of progressive policy issues (entrepreneurs, women in finance, economic empowerment)
Process-oriented, attentive to detail, highly organized and skilled at juggling numerous stakeholders and priorities simultaneously
Familiarity with Office, Google Drive and Salesforce preferred
Ability to collaborate with co-workers across positions on multiple projects
Completed coursework or relevant experience in non-profit management or a related field
Be heart-driven, positive, collaborative, fun, and kind – and want to be part of a team and network that feels the same!
It’s even better if you…
Love, and excel at, building processes from the ground up. Attention to detail, strategic thinking, and strong organizational and interpersonal skills are essential.
Feel comfortable working in an entrepreneurial environment where not all of the questions have been answered. You should bring a fine-tuned sense of when to take initiative and work independently, and when to ask for help.
Have a can-do attitude, the ability to improvise and implement solutions, and stellar follow-up and follow-through skills. You’ll be working on a small team making a big difference in the world.
