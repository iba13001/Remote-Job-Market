Our mission is to simplify real estate investment by connecting investors to high quality commercial real estate transactions. Real estate is the most popular asset class in the world, and probably the most fraught with peril for the individual investor. Individuals have extremely limited information and access beyond their own neighborhood. The ability to do due diligence is minimal, and it is complex to negotiate, purchase, manage, and liquidate.

RealtyMogul was created to make this asset class available. We allow our investors to buy portions of properties instead of entire ones or get exposure to multiple properties via third party funds or our proprietary REITs. We source the partners or investments ourselves, diligence them ourselves and walk every property that we offer up for investment.

We have been at it for 7 years and have backed more than 70 operating partners across the country in addition to building our own direct acquisitions team. We have learned what a great property that is well managed looks like. We leverage our experience to find the best deals, actively asset manage, and maximize our investors' returns.

Today we are one of the largest, most recognizable brands in online real estate crowdfunding, with over $600 Million in capital invested into over $2.8 billion of real estate nationwide. We were recently named the #1 Commercial Real Estate Crowdfunding Platform by Motley Fool. We remain focused on building the best online experience to enable investment into highly vetted commercial real estate assets and to educate our growing user base about the many aspects of real estate investing, all through an online, scalable platform.

The Climate Center,2 days ago,LA,L.A. Regional Organizer,,NA,"LA Regional Organizer
Reports to: Chief Strategist

Location: Los Angeles, remote (potential office post COVID)_

Status: Full-Time with Benefits


Are you a dynamic, accomplished organizer and relationship-builder wanting to make a difference on climate change? We are looking for a smart, collaborative, enthusiastic, professional to lead our Climate-Safe California partnership and organizing efforts in Southern California. Working collaboratively, we will accelerate equitable climate policy based on the latest science and the rapidly worsening climate reality globally, and in California.


About The Climate Center

The Climate Center, a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization, works to deliver rapid greenhouse gas reductions at scale, starting in California. Founded in 2001, The Climate Center played a key role in the tremendous growth of Community Choice Agencies (CCAs), local government-led alternatives to investor owned utilities. CCAs grew from 2 to 23 over the past 6 years and now provide 88% clean energy to over 11 million Californians.
The Climate Center has launched a bold, science-based campaign, Climate-Safe California, to accelerate climate action timelines in California, catalyzing other states, our nation and countries around the world to greater action for a climate-safe future.


Our goal is that California, the world’s fifth largest economy, achieves net-negative emissions, draw down of past emissions greater than current emissions, by 2030, 15 years ahead of current law. This entails for main areas of policy: phasing out fossil fuels in electricity transportation, building and industry sectors; ramping up investments in nature-based sequestration of past emissions on natural and working lands; ensuring resilience in all of our communities to increasing extreme events and power shutoffs; and securing the billions of dollars needed annually to realize these urgent goals.
Our policies and programs, guided by these three key principles, must: (1) be based on the latest science, (2) ensure a just transition for workers, their families and their communities, dependent on fossil fuel industries, and, (3), prioritize climate justice to ensure that low income communities and communities of color are no longer disproportionately harmed by the production and use of fossil fuels, and the growing impacts of climate change with equitable access to climate-friendly solutions.
The Organizer and Partnership Coordinator will play a key role mobilizing California to support this urgently needed campaign.


Position Description

The Organizer is responsible for recruiting and mobilizing and tracking partner organizations across cross sectors starting in the LA Region to build an engaged base of support to take action in support of the urgent Climate-Safe California goals.

Child-like Joy: We aspire to experience child-like joy in our work and lives, injecting a spirit of passion, optimism and laughter into everything that we do.
Shoshin: We believe in a beginner's mind. Don't surround yourself with people like you-diversity breeds creativity.
Stay Thirsty, My Friends: We believe in a totally internally-driven strive for greatness. The solution is think more, not doing more.

Why You'll Love It Here

Accordion Partners,Today,LA,"Financial Accounting Advisory Services, Consultant",,NA,"Company Overview

In 2009, Accordion set out to prove that there was a better way to work in finance – and more specifically, a better way to unlock value potential in private equity portfolio companies. In the years since, our firm has grown into a bi-coastal team of 150+ finance and technology professionals, serving nearly 200 of the world's leading private equity firms out of offices in New York, San Francisco, Boston, Charlotte, and Dallas.

Our mission is to shape a new era in the private equity industry. Focusing exclusively on the office of the CFO of PE-backed companies, we're committed to driving value creation through financial consulting services and portfolio operations technology.

So, what does it mean to work at Accordion? It means thriving in a high-growth, agile, and collaborative environment. It means changing the way private equity firms create value at their portfolio companies. And ultimately, it means making your mark on the firm's future – by embracing a culture rooted in humility and a firm-wide commitment to building something great, together.

Financial Accounting Advisory Services (FAAS)

With the increase in complexity of the business environment and transactions, CFO's of private equity backed companies are increasingly being looked towards to drive strategic insights for their business. Finance organizations are no longer simply result reporters, but rather, they couple these results with forward looking data to provide strategic insights which are leveraged to make business decisions. Efficiency of process and meaningful control environments allows for speed of financial reporting with increasingly accurate measures, leaving more time for the finance team to add future enterprise value, rather than look backwards.

Accordion's FAAS Practice is comprised of a dedicated team providing accounting and financial advice to support PE backed portfolio companies on a wide range of transactions and events, including Accounting Policies & Procedures, ERP/Financial System Execution, Financial Statement Close Process, Process & Controls Implementation, Technical Accounting, Finance/Accounting Assessment & Design and Finance & Accounting Organization Standup resulting from a Carve out or Merger transaction. We are doers and problem solvers – making sense of complexity and bolstering sponsors' value creation thesis's.

This is a contracting role reporting to the Managing Director of the FAAS Practice, and will be working remote with some travel in the future.

UMAC aims to help entrepreneurs in these industries with either a profitable exit, a growth strategy, or a turnaround in case of a struggling business.If you join us, you will be a UMAC Associate taking a fair share of the rewards that each deal will provide.This is youYou’re an exceptionally orderly and industrious A-player ready to work long hours according to a fixed format, setting up contacts with entrepreneurs and following up on their initial response. Your army-inspired sense of discipline is only matched by your risk-taking and creativity. You need to be able to think out-of-the-box, as every deal comes with its specifics, and instead of a fixed salary you have the will to go all-in and reap the massive benefits towards the end of the line.It pays to have a warm personality, as you will need to be able to build a rapport with the prospective seller, and give them a sense of assurance that UMAC is a safe pair of hands. It’s mostly down to persistence and your powers of persuasion, as you will be UMAC’s initial calling card for dozens of prospective sellers, getting them ready to engage in a discovery call with one of UMAC’s partners.This means that: You have true entrepreneurial spirit and a personality capable of stepping back from instant gratification.

You reach this point by creating thought-provoking posts and socially engaging in discussion groups, before personally connecting with relevant entrepreneurs. Your first calls should allow you to qualify each lead and get them ready for a discovery call with one of our partners.It helps to have a sizable LinkedIn network before starting as a UMAC associate, and you must be prepared to adapt your profile to UMAC’s needs. We are not looking for the slick and smooth-talking second-hand car-salesman type, but instead we aim for the creative soul with thriving interpersonal skills.Your creativity and compassion must be bolstered by a fixed daily routine of sending messages and making calls while waiting no less than 24 hours before following up on any sign of life from within your network. Discussing with prospective sellers, you are able to quickly visualise solutions that will help them move forward – which means that you have a good grasp of what it takes to run a successful business.It’s obvious that your command of the English language is near-perfect, while also being well-versed in at least one other language – such as (but not limited to) Spanish, German, or French, is a huge benefit.This is our dealYou will work with one or more of UMAC’s partners, each of them fully capable of quickly closing a profitable deal.

Enhancify,14 days ago,LA,Jr. Sales Rep - Fast-Growing FinTech Startup - $70K-170K (Remote),US work authorization (Required)Bachelor's (Preferred)Sales Experience: 1 year (Preferred),"$70,000 - $170,000 a year","Please Read Carefully: Position: Junior Sales ManagerCompensation: $70-$170KCompany & Context: Enhancify is a fast-growing fintech startup with a clear mission: to help home improvement contractors (roofers, general contractors, remodelers, etc) build the American dream for themselves, their teams, and their communities.Specifically, we are disrupting the home improvement lending industry through an innovative point-of-sale tech platform that helps contractors seamlessly turn expensive projects into low monthly payments, while giving homeowners the ability to complete their dream projects and build value in their homes.The problem we solve is dealer fees. Traditionally, today’s old-school financing companies require contractors to pay a percentage of their project in exchange for financing. This results in an average loss of 20-40% of the profit margin, while rejecting many homeowners who don’t have excellent credit.We’ve built a software solution that empowers contractors to win more jobs by offering attractive payment options to homeowners, without paying dealer fees, and while being able to serve a large community of customers.Performance to Date: We launched about 30 months ago and are profitable. We have 1,500+ paying customers (unlike most startups) and are completely bootstrapped. We’ve built partnerships with top lending networks of America (Goldman Sachs, LendingClub, SoFi, etc.) as well as banks and credit unions and are currently sitting on ~$30B in capital to deploy through our platform.Our lean but scrappy team consists of experienced industry veterans in the digital credit, B2B SaaS, and enterprise-software spaces, as well as folks who are from the trades/home-services and get it. As a team, we are solving difficult problems, working hard, and successfully competing against billion-dollar publicly-traded competition.The Opportunity: We are seeking exceptional, ""A"" players to add to our core team in the form of a Junior Sales Manager. In the last few years we’ve validated a need the market is starving for, demonstrated an ability to sell, and are now obsessed about creating an industry-changing customer experience. We need the right people to help us put fuel on the fire.- This is an entry-level sales position. We are looking to mold and create closers, not hire them. We're looking for raw ingredients.- You will be cold-calling every day. If the idea of making 150 dials a day is something that makes you nervous, this is not for you.- Unlike most Junior sales positions, you will also be closing. We will mold you into someone who can not just sell, but close. You will be leading an end-to-end sales process yourself, generating opportunities, developing relationships, and generating revenue as a Closer. You will also have accountability as an individual contributor.- You will generate revenue, be evaluated by your ability to do so (and have fun while doing it)- You will be helping contractors grow their businesses. You will be their champion, relentlessly focused on providing more value and learning about the market. Aside from closing clients, you will also ensure your customers are successful over the long-term.- You will be a multi-channel sales practitioner, selling on the phone, over email, and video recordings- You will be trained and molded by a successful team. This is a difficult, challenging, ""slog-filled"" role. However, if you are successful here, you will develop a lethal skillset that will serve you well for the rest of your life.- You will get hands-on experience working in a high-paced startup environment. That means together we will make decisions, make mistakes, and make improvements.About You (Personality): - You're hungry as hell. You're extremely results oriented. You don't make excuses and find ways to get the job done, period. You have a clear and powerful reason why you need to succeed right now.- You have Grit. You can take damage day after day. Working in an early-stage company is hard. You have a demonstrated ability to slog through difficult situations where most others would quit. You won't give up because of bad days, weeks, or months. Once you have a vision in your mind, you will make it happen.- You have a relentless commitment to Excellence. You're obsessed with not just becoming the best at what you do (you love to compete and win)...but with pulling your best out of you. You can always improve. When you hit your goal, you know it's time to raise your standards.- Above all, you are Trustworthy. While you love to win, your core desire is to help people. You have an unshakeable sense of ethics. Your core values are honesty, loyalty, and integrity. You take complete responsibility when you screw up.- While you love to win, your core desire is to help people. You have an unshakeable sense of ethics and are trustworthy. Your core values are honesty, loyalty, and integrity. You take complete responsibility when you screw up.- You're smart and systems-minded.

You want to punch the clock, do the bare minimum, and chill.- You've been in sales for more than 3 years- You have more than 5 years of professional experience (out of school). We're looking for people just out of school / beginning their careers.- You need a lot of structure, hand-holding, or accountability.

We often find that customers need us to help them uncover what they don’t know and rely on the leadership qualities of our team to divine a path to their intended outcome. Successful candidates in this position will understand the overall sales cycle and the role they play in future opportunities. Our team evangelizes outcomes and serves as a conduit to “what is possible'' for our customers via our delivery organization. They must also assist in enabling the sales community to do the same wherever possible.
Solution Leads need exceptional consulting skills and must be able to articulate the value proposition of professional services. It’s critical that they evangelize a holistic view of services engagement alongside software solutions that drive better outcomes for our clients’ strategic and tactical efforts. The Solution Lead team is made up of people with an opinionated consultative mindset based on past experience, case study, collaboration, and deep understanding of client challenges. They are responsible for scoping the work and shaping the requirements of solution development for professional platform services. Members of the team should also be capable of communicating objective and sometimes painful truths to all audiences as well as be comfortable facilitating discussions and presentations with groups of any size. Solution Leads should inspire confidence in our customers that we can help them to achieve their incredibly challenging goals, goals they more often than not do not have the experience or personnel to solve themselves. You need to be relationship-oriented as you will serve as the bridge between core sales, specialist sales, TLS sales, and services delivery teams.
Having a consulting mindset is essential, which means listening to a customer’s questions and requirements, asking clarifying questions, and providing constructive feedback based on expertise in deployment, management and governance of complex systems. Most importantly, members of our team need an inquiring mind that asks relevant and probing questions to ensure we build the best solution to meet the customer’s requirements.

Overview

About Caring Across Generations:

The way we work has changed, our families have changed - but care hasn’t. With millennials becoming parents and Baby Boomers getting older, the need for care is surging. Yet many people can’t just rely on family for the support they need, and paid caregivers barely make enough to support their own families.

Caring Across Generations is an intersectional campaign working to make care more affordable and accessible at every stage of life, while making sure caregivers are treated with respect and dignity. Founded in 2011 by workers’ rights activists Sarita Gupta and Ai-jen Poo, we’re focused on creating change in three ways: organizing a powerful movement of the Caring Majority, fighting for groundbreaking policy at the state level and federal level, and changing hearts and minds through storytelling and leveraging pop culture. We were behind the historic win to extend federal minimum wage and overtime protections to home care workers, and in 2018, helped Washington state create the nation's first universal public program for long-term care.

About the Position:

The California Care Campaign Organizer will recruit and organize family caregivers, people with disabilities, seniors and other care recipients to join Caring Across Generations in the fight to expand and improve California’s care infrastructure. The Organizer will grow our base of 12 coalition partner organizations to the size and power needed to launch a city-based Universal Family Care (UFC) pilot campaign in 2022. UFC is a new holistic, sustainable framework that ensures every family will be able to afford childcare, paid family and medical leave, AND supports for loved ones who are aging or living with a disability. This position will also bring leaders together at key moments to support the federal Care Infrastructure agenda.

Responsibilities

Recruit, organize and develop a multi-racial, multi-ethnic, multi-generational grassroots base of unpaid family caregivers, people with disabilities and seniors, with a focus on developing BIPOC family caregivers,' to win Care policy.
Build relationships with allied organizations, faith communities, elected officials, and policy-makers.
Mobilize local grassroots leaders to support federal campaign actions and events to move our Care agenda at the federal level.
Monitor and impact local decision-making bodies on programs and policies that directly impact family caregivers.
Run effective and engaging webinar and in-person trainings.
Lead well-planned and executed base-building meetings.
Organize non-partisan Civic and Voter Engagement campaigns as needed.


Qualifications

At least three years of experience in building grassroots membership, identifying local ways to take action, and experience training grassroots leaders on issues.
Communicates well and comfortably among a racially diverse set of people with a strong social justice lens and an appetite to undo racism, sexism, misogyny, classism, ableism, homophobia, xenophobia, and other forms of oppression.
Excellent interpersonal skills (one-on-one and in group contexts), cultural competencies, strong listening skills, patience, and humor.
Ability to work as part of a strong team as well as independently.
Strong organizational skills and ability to manage multiple tasks in high-paced, low structure organization.
Ability to work flexible hours to meet program requirements and community needs, including evenings and weekends.
Experience working with Voter Activation Network (VAN) desirable.
Experience organizing with people with disabilities, multi-racial constituencies, and/or multi-generational constituencies desirable.


Travel

Must be willing and able to travel. Generally, openness to traveling 1-2 times per 2 month for 1-3 days around California once we begin to allow staff to travel again.

Truvani,28 days ago,LA,Call Center Sales Phone Rep for Health Food Ecommerce Company (Work from Home),,From $15 an hour,"Do you want to help us change the food industry from the INSIDE out? Do you love making someone's day when they least expect it? Are you comfortable talking to people on the phone? Does being involved in sales sound exciting?

If your answer to all of those questions is ""Yes!"", keep reading because...

We're hiring a Call Center Sales Phone Representative, and I believe you'd be a perfect fit.

The best part?

This is a full-time, virtual position. You can work from the comfort of your home!

(Please note: This is NOT for people looking for part-time positions or consulting contracts).

About Truvani

I'm an activist at heart.

I built a following and, together with my readers (The Food Babe Army), we got major corporations to change some of their reckless practices. But these companies don't change fast enough...

For lasting change, we need to take on the food industry head-on. That's why I started Truvani: to create the products I *wish* I could find in stores.

At Truvani, we believe in real food without added chemicals, products without toxins, and labels without lies.

That's why, for example, we will always be transparent with our ingredient sourcing and pick only the best ingredients available.

In short: We put PEOPLE over profits.

As a Call Center Sales Representative, you will be a crucial part of that mission by connecting with customers to both EDUCATE and MATCH their needs to our products.

Here's what you need to know about this position:

About the Position

Truvani is growing fast!

We already have thousands of customers and we're developing multiple new products that are coming soon. This means...

We need your help as the first point of contact for our customers.

Treating our customers with respect in all interactions is VITAL for our company. We want to put people first in every way - not just in how we source our ingredients. That's why this role and providing top-notch customer service is so important.

So, what does this mean in terms of what we're looking for in our call center phone reps?

We want you to be EXCITED about helping to match our customers with products and deals. This requires communication skills, enthusiasm for sales, empathy, and a passion for talking (and listening!) to people. You'll need to put yourself in our customers' shoes. You'll need to speak their language. You'll need to be highly informed about our products.

And you'll need to take ownership of these tasks.

This means you might have to do some digging in our systems in order to resolve billing issues, handle customer complaints, or gather valuable customer feedback.

So, besides excellent phone and written communication skills, we're looking for someone who's curious about other people AND someone who is not afraid to sell.

Here are some of the things you'll do:


Reach out to our customer base on a regular basis to ensure they're having the best experience with us

Keep customers satisfied by LISTENING and figuring out what they really want

Communicate with customers almost exclusively by phone

Proactively contact customers for new product offers and sales exclusives

Steer customer conversations toward win/win outcomes

Maintain a solid knowledge-base of our product suite, prices, and combination possibilities

Feel comfortable talking and selling to different kinds of people all day

Answer questions and educate customers about Truvani products and values

Recommend ways to improve our support processes, scripts, and tools


Why You'll Love Working for Truvani

This position has high expectations, but here's the deal:


You'll be paid to do what you already love... help people.
You'll get to work in a fast-growing company with lots of opportunities to grow (now and in the future).
You'll have the chance to contribute to the company's growth in a unique way
You'll be an integral part of our mission to change the broken food system - from the inside out.


We're building a food company that puts people - and their health - first.

This Position is PERFECT For You If...

If you're excited about this opportunity, here are the requirements:


You must have experience dealing with customer emails, phone calls, and other interactions.

You know that great customer service depends on both analytical thinking as well as emotional IQ. And you know how to blend both.

You know when it's appropriate to be friendly and accommodating and you know when it's appropriate to be stern.

You must be proficient with Google Docs and Excel. Ideally, you'll already be familiar with different CRM systems and best practices.

You must be willing to take ownership of your role and be responsible for meeting daily stats. We're a fast-growing company and we want to figure out the best ways to serve our customers. We're hoping you will have the creativity and willingness to come up with some of those key initiatives.

Rabbit Hole,29 days ago,LA,Staff Writer,Language:English (Required),NA,"What’s Rabbit Hole?Rabbit Hole is a new magazine of ideas for East Asia, offering quality features, analysis, and commentary.Check out our website here:https://rabbitholemag.com/It’s irreverent, fiercely independent, and answerable to no one and nothing save for the highest standards of journalism. It models itself on the best – The New Yorker, The Atlantic, Time (at its height) – and offers articles that are both timely and timeless.For that, though, we need the best people.What will a staff writer do?You will:Contribute an article every 2 weeks (You’ll be paid per article rather than a salary)Attend fortnightly online meetingsPlease only apply if you can commit to this.Who are you looking for?We’re unabashedly elitist. The media scene in East Asia is a field of gnats, and most journalists here are hopeless at anything beyond the most basic reporting. We’re looking for the 1% who aren’t.A strong candidate will be:A great writer – Your words dance, your sentences sing, your writing is fresh, eloquent, and endlessly entertaining. Rabbit Hole will treat writing as an art form, and we need writers who aspire to no less.A thinker – Rabbit Hole is an intellectual brothel, and each staff writer will be a thinker and a star in his or her own right. You’ll be smart enough to grasp complicated issues and explain them simply enough for any reasonably intelligent person to understand. You’ll make people think. Your articles will add value to the conversation, and will still be worth reading months, or even years, later.A self-starter – Since our staff writers will be based in different countries around the world, each must be able to work with minimal supervision. Our editors will guide you, and will sometimes assign you stories, but for the most part you’ll take the initiative to come up with and pursue unique story ideas yourself.A hard worker – Rabbit Hole is a news startup and we have a lot to prove. We can’t afford to take it easy.Independent – Good journalists operate without fear or favor. You’ll be ok with offending people on either side of the political spectrum in the service of the truth, and with being part of an outfit that does.Versatile – There’s nothing more boring than a journalist who writes about the same thing all the time. At Rabbit Hole we don’t believe in beats or focuses or any of those other things that straightjacket journalists. Indeed, we push our writers to get out of their comfort zone and learn new things. If you need to become knowledgeable on something you know nothing about within a week, you’ll relish the challenge.Why might I be interested?Flexible work arrangement – Work whenever and wherever you like.No office politics – Comes of not having a physical office.Minimal professional opportunity cost – Since you’re required only to contribute an article every two weeks, you’ll be able to be a staff writer whilst holding a part-time or full-time job elsewhere.Fair remuneration – You’ll be paid $300 for each article (sometimes more in special circumstances), a figure matching market rate at other high quality publications.Creative freedom – You’ll have plenty of freedom to write on whatever interests you.We’re a meritocracy – At Rabbit Hole your ability to deliver great articles is what matters most. Nothing else, not your background, not your experience, not your position, counts for near as much.Grow as a writer – A magazine is only as good as its writers, and we’ll invest in you. We’ll push you to become a better writer, and then we’ll push you some more.Join an A-team – By becoming a staff writer at Rabbit Hole you become part of a team of elite writers from all over the world who share ideas and help each other grow.Shape journalism in East Asia – Rabbit Hole is an organization like no other. It’ll establish a new tradition in journalism in this part of the world. Help us leave a mark. We can’t say it’ll be easy, but it will be interesting.How do I apply?If this sounds like something you’d like to be part of, please send us:Your CV;A cover letter explaining why you’re interested in this position and why you’d be a great candidate, and;Three writing samples (if you don’t have any, we can arrange for you to make some).Email them in to:shaun.tan[at]rabbitholemag.comIf you have any questions related to this position, or if you can think of any other way you could be of service to us, don’t hesitate to get in touch either.Job Type: Part-timeLanguage:English (Required)Work Remotely:Yes"
