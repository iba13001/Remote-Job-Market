Calibrate,4 days ago,NYC,Content Designer,,NA,"OUR MISSION

Obesity is America's underlying pandemic, and science shows that lasting weight loss is driven by improving our metabolic health.

At Calibrate, we're defining metabolic health as a new consumer category, one that mirrors what the research shows—that weight reflects our biology, not our willpower. Our program was designed by world leaders in obesity and nutrition science to drive long-term weight loss in a way that's proven to be impactful, realistic, and sustainable.

To bring Calibrate to everyone who needs it, we're building the first direct-to-consumer telemedicine business within the healthcare ecosystem, aligning incentives for doctors, insurers, pharmaceutical companies, and consumers. By leveraging technology, Calibrate is closing the gap in care for 175mm American adults in a $600bn market where Americans spend millions of dollars and do not lose millions of pounds.

Our doctor-guided program defines a new standard of clinical care, bringing decades of academic research to everyone, everywhere. Calibrate combines FDA-approved metabolic medication with a holistic curriculum and 1:1 virtual coaching sessions that drive lasting behavior change. The result is a metabolic reset that delivers sustainable weight loss and success beyond the scale, with improved whole-body health that enables our members to embrace a new day-to-day.

OUR VALUES

We're in this together: We have an audacious mission, and we're building a lot of things for the first time — from the first DTC pharma business within the healthcare ecosystem to the data infrastructure for providing real-world evidence in the largest category of chronic disease. It takes superpowers to build something simple and intuitive within the complex healthcare market, so we identify and work as a team from our individual points of strength. Not everyone has to be good at everything, but we know that when we harness what we're each great at, we're unstoppable.

Small wins create big wins: We ground every experience in optimism, recognizing and celebrating successes along the way. We break projects down into smaller components. And we focus on where we have momentum. We always plan for larger goals with the knowledge that our plans will evolve as we achieve smaller milestones.

You're in control: While we're headquartered in New York, we don't let location stand in the way of the best talent — and from coaches to engineers, many of us are fully remote. Our business is multi-faceted, so each Calibrater is hired to be an expert in their piece of it — in control of their own initiatives, in control of their own impact, and in control of driving their own (real) results.

Real results matter: We're obsessed with outcomes because when our members win, we win, and the data proves that we've built the best metabolic health program on the market. We're purposeful, optimistic, and relentlessly confident that we can solve the biggest medical issue of the 21st century."

Why You Fit At Forum
You are customer obsessed. Customers are your ""North Star"" and you bring them ""into the room"" when planning and making decisions. You worry about customers more than competitors.
You are an owner. For you, there's no such thing as ""it's not my job."" You take pride in, and accountability for, results. No problem is too big, too small, or too outside of your scope to jump in and help.
You are a doer. You have a bias towards action and are able to thrive in a fast-paced, dynamic work environment. You independently identify both issues and opportunities and run towards them.
You are scrappy. You find ways to do more with less. You recognize that resources are easily depleted, but resourcefulness is a skill that compounds over time.

We are builders. We believe that the only way to get the future that we want is to build it. Building consumer brands that excite and delight customers is our highest calling, and we come to work each day in service of that cause.

We apply immense rigor in making people decisions, and take seriously our responsibility to develop our people, because we know that it is our people that will take us from good to great.
We are explorers. We are curious by nature and constantly learning. We design experiments and test hypotheses quickly, cheaply, and in all facets of our business.
We are not perfect. We hold a worldview of humility and recognize that we will make mistakes, but that they will not define us — they are simply data points to inform future decisions.
You come as you are. You draw inspiration from an environment where the best ideas win, regardless of where they come from. Like us, you celebrate diversity of all kinds. You share our commitment as an equal opportunity employer to building an inclusive Forum where people thrive by being their authentic selves and are empowered to do their best work each day.

Marketing | San Francisco, CA, United States or Remote (North America)
VMware’s Modern Application Platforms Business Unit (MAPBU) has a bold mission—catalyze enterprise transformation through software. At the center of telling this narrative and empowering sales is product marketing.
Product marketing takes a unique combination of skills. To be a product marketer is to be savvy of technology industry dynamics and trends, a messaging expert, a constant collaborator with marketing and go-to-market teams, and a creative producer of content that cuts across product positioning to industry commentary.
Job Role and Responsibilities:
MAPBU is seeking a Product Marketer to run product marketing for a crucial area of our VMware Tanzu Labs business: the software consulting services that help our customers build, run and manage modern application platforms.
Organizations of all sizes are investing in Kubernetes and related technologies. The experts at VMware Tanzu Labs have unique capabilities to help these firms achieve better outcomes with K8s and the broader ecosystem of open-source projects. Tanzu Labs does this through custom engagements with IT leaders and practitioners looking to build and develop a modern app platform and establish modern operations practices for sustained success.
This Product Marketing role will play a critical part in our success—shaping our overarching platform services narrative, and establishing Tanzu Labs as the go-to partner for enterprises that want to adopt Kubernetes as their standard infrastructure API.
We count on Product Marketing to define messaging, drive sales enablement, understand and grow our platform services, feed campaigns, drive the agenda at industry conferences like VMworld and SpringOne, and collaborate across business units to amplify the Tanzu Labs value proposition.
This role also has the potential for greater company-wide impact, informing VMware’s perspective on business-aligned open source technology, subscription-based businesses, and engagement with new customer personas.
Responsibilities may include, but are not limited to:
Product positioning. Define the core messaging framework for owned products, socialize across stakeholders, and apply to a core set of marketing materials.
Sales enablement. Ready our sales specialists to carry our message(s) to market with consistency and confidence through annual sales kick-off sessions and ongoing training. Drive the Tanzu Labs platform services journey message for the Tanzu Labs sales specialists, MAPBU field, core VMware field, channel partners, and the broader market.
Content creation. Create external-facing content (slide decks, briefs, blogs, papers, multimedia, reference architectures, etc.) aligned to campaigns, sales needs, and competitive threats.
Required Skills & Experience:
Product Marketing. At least five (5) years of product marketing or product management experience. You'll need to have seen the full cycle of product launches and transitions to be effective.
An intermediate understanding of cloud-native technologies and practices. You'll need to be familiar with popular open-source projects and modern DevOps practices. Familiarity with Kubernetes and other CNCF projects is preferred.
Student. You don’t need to be a certified Kubernetes admin, but you’ve got to have the desire to really dig in and understand the technology and its impact in enterprises.
Organizer & communicator. You’ll need to stay on top of multiple product threads, collaborate with different business units, marketing teams, and a globally distributed base of Tanzu Labs practitioners. Demands for collateral and messaging support will compete for your time; you’ll need to ruthlessly prioritize.
Storyteller and writer. This isn’t a behind-the-scenes role; you’ll need to collaborate with stakeholders across VMware and stay in close communication with/present frequently to sales reps and sales leadership. You need to have the ability to break down complex concepts into extremely simple and clear terms for sales. Strong written communication will serve you for internal and external content.
Presentation skills. The ability to deliver clear and concise training and webinars - supplemented by clean visual materials like slide decks - is critical for this role.
Preferred Skills:
Fluent in aspects of modern IT operations. Ideally, you’ve worked in and around the Cloud Native Computing Foundation ecosystem. Familiarity with containers and modern platform operational best practices will help you quickly get up to speed on the broader VMware Labs value proposition.
Data analysis. Experience using campaign data and sales data to determine enablement priorities and to measure the effectiveness of your efforts.

Oatly Inc.,6 days ago,NYC,Supply Chain Systems Manager (Remote),,NA,"Hello potential future Oatly employee. It’s us, the original oatmilk company that started in Sweden back 25 or so years ago and has since expanded to the U.S. where we’ve continued growing at a rate such that we need more brilliant minds to come work with us to keep the momentum going and the oatmilk flowing.

Sustainability, health, and transparency are the core values that guide everything we do. Basically, we exist to make it easy for people to eat better and live healthier lives without recklessly taxing the planet’s resources in the process. If any of this resonates with you, then maybe you’d like work for Oatly, too. Now onto the formal stuff.

We are looking for a Supply Chain Systems Manager to join our team. The chief goals for this position are to implement, maintain, and support the US Supply Chain and inventory systems. This support will extend from our host ERP system, through applications and software such as EDI, TMS, planning software, etc. The Supply Chain Systems Manager will work with the business owners to ensure the systems support and enhance all processes throughout the supply chain.
Here are the things we want to hire you to do:
Manage the deployment, maintenance, and troubleshooting of our core business applications
Meet and coordinate with internal and external stakeholders to establish project scopes, system goals, and requirements
Work with IT department to represent the systems needs of the US Supply Chain, logistics and Inventory organization
Develop, analyze, prioritize, and organize requirement specifications, flowcharts for developers and testers to follow
Coordinate the set-up and configuration of systems, with appropriate business partners
Define and coordinate the execution of testing procedures and develop test cases to serve the overall quality assurance process
Provide documentation of all processes and training as needed
Implement best practices for scalability, supportability, ease of maintenance, and system performance
Here are the things we think you need:
Bachelor's degree in computer science or information technology, or equivalent experience
5-10 years’ experience working in a similar role as a systems analyst
Strong understanding of ERP systems, preferably Microsoft D365
Proven ability to assess business needs and translate them into relevant solutions
Experience installing, configuring, documenting, testing, training, and implementing new applications and systems

Here is another list of qualities we think make a good Oatly team member:
You feel connected to our mission of encouraging health, sustainability, and transparency
You are a self-starter who doesn’t need direct supervision to motivate you for success – we believe strongly in building a culture of individual accountability and ownership. Oatly needs partners that can embrace that mentality and be able to exceed expectations while working independently
You are ready to make your mark in a smaller, growing brand leveraging your experience to deliver amazing results to continue building an outstanding company
You have entrepreneurial spirit; in that you are comfortable with ambiguity and are energized by the process of building something lasting from the ground up
You enjoy sharing your quirkiness and talents with your coworkers
Another bulleted list felt redundant, so we wrote this long sentence with all the ways we sweeten the deal to work with us, like providing flexible vacation for starters, really great benefits with 100% medical coverage, genuinely great coworkers who want to see the company and each other succeed, a start-up vibe with an established company history, and a fridge full of the best non-dairy alternative in the world for your enjoyment.

Oatly Inc.,6 days ago,NYC,Global Trade & Compliance Analyst (Remote),,NA,"Hello potential future Oatly employee. It’s us, the original oatmilk company that started in Sweden back 25 or so years ago and has since expanded to the U.S. where we’ve continued growing at a rate such that we need more brilliant minds to come work with us to keep the momentum going and the oatmilk flowing.

Sustainability, health, and transparency are the core values that guide everything we do. Basically, we exist to make it easy for people to eat better and live healthier lives without recklessly taxing the planet’s resources in the process. If any of this resonates with you, then maybe you’d like work for Oatly, too. Now onto the formal stuff.
We are looking for a Global Trade & Compliance Analyst to join our team. This role will be responsible for providing operational excellence around all Import / Export transactions and activities between Oatly North America and our Global partners. This individual will establish and maintain strong customer relationships and serve as the single point of contact between freight forwarders, custom brokers, operators, and all International customers to ensure optimum customer service and deliver maximum advantage to the business in the most sustainable, efficient way possible. Additionally, you’ll be responsible for ensuring legal compliance within US Customs & Border Protection rules and regulations.
Here are the things we want to hire you to do:
Manage all import/export daily activities including, but not limited to, all global transaction trade & planning, import/export specific data entry, documentation tracking for all International shipments (air and ocean), including both import and export, maintain accurate import/export compliance record keeping in accordance with US Customs and Border Protection
Plan, quote, direct, and monitor all air and ocean shipments for Oatly import and export operations
Act as the liaison for Oatly North America and customs authorities - this involves research of contested issues, coming up with resolutions to potential customs assessments called out by customs authorities and ensuring timely and compliant filings with governmental authorities
Maintain knowledge of ocean freight tariffs, INCOTERMS, and contracts; as well as container/bunker fuel charges, etc. for successful negotiations with ocean carriers and service providers
Track and monitor entire process of cargo movement and keep customers up to date on movement details based on their expectations
Address any issues that delay the clearance of goods through the import/export entry process, in relation to import logistics in conjunction with the manager of Customs Compliance
Partner with US Customs Compliance to ensure that Warehouse service providers meet the Customs-Trade Partnership Against Terrorism (C-TPAT) minimum security criteria
Ensure all daily, weekly, and monthly Import/Export reports are completed accurately and on time
Maintain excellent cross functional relationships with Oatly corporate personnel, external vendor partners, carriers and internal Warehouse/D.C. team members and managers
Here are the things we think you need:
A solid understanding of Global Trade rules & regulations, Compliance, and Import/Export INCOTERMS
Experience with TMS systems, including prior experiences selecting a TMS supplier, implementing a TMS and maintaining a TMS system
An analytical mindset that can take data, extract meaningful and actionable information, and confidently present it to supply chain leadership
A working knowledge of ERP systems, ideally Microsoft Dynamics 365, and a Solid working proficiency with Excel
An ability to work cross functionally in order to provide accurate and timely Information to our Customer service & Supply Chain teams
A desire to grow within the logistics function and assume increasing levels of responsibility as we continue with our evolution
Here is another list of qualities we think make a good Oatly team member:
You feel connected to our mission of encouraging health, sustainability, and transparency
You are a self-starter who doesn’t need direct supervision to motivate you for success – we believe strongly in building a culture of individual accountability and ownership; Oatly needs partners that can embrace that mentality and be able to exceed expectations while working independently
You are ready to make your mark in a smaller, growing brand leveraging your experience to deliver amazing results to continue building an outstanding company
You have entrepreneurial spirit; in that you are comfortable with ambiguity and are energized by the process of building something lasting from the ground up
You enjoy sharing your quirkiness and talents with your coworkers
Another bulleted list felt redundant, so we wrote this long sentence with all the ways we sweeten the deal to work with us, like providing flexible vacation for starters, really great benefits with 100% medical coverage, genuinely great coworkers who want to see the company and each other succeed, a start-up vibe with an established company history, and being part of a story which changed the world.
Oatly is an equal opportunity employer. All qualified applicants will receive consideration for employment without regard to race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, national origin, disability or veteran status."

The Class by Taryn Toomey,6 days ago,NYC,Junior Creative Content Producer,,NA,"Company Description

The Class (www.theclass.com) is a global wellness brand. Our core product is cathartic workout experience that guides you to strengthen the body and notice the mind to restore balance. The company is rooted in four primary lines of business: digital, in-studio, events, and retail.

Job Description

Are you a passionate, technically proficient, creative professional? Do you like seahorses? One of these things is very important to us. We’re looking for a modern-day renaissance design and creative content person to help us make things. Wonderful things. Wonderful creative things. It’s simple...and complicated. Let’s go deeper…
We need to present our business and our brand (to our customers, to ourselves, and to our partners) with visual and contextual polish and clarity. We do so in a thousand big and small ways (through the sign on the wall you see when you enter one of our studios, through the content you see on our social media channels and our website, through the jewelry we design and sell, through the decks we present to our business partners, etc.). We need your help in crafting all of those things. And I mean ALL of those things. Walk with me…

Qualifications

These are the things (we hope) you are made of:
Artisanal, organic, non-GMO, fair trade blueberry cinnamon maple syrup. If not though…that’s cool. No one’s perfect.
You are equal parts designer (technically proficient in both print and interactive design principles and best practices) and creative content manager (able to “handle” expressing a brand on social and other media). You can use Photoshop and Adobe Premier (or maybe iMovie/FinalCut). You know what a content calendar is. You are not afraid of writing words that appear in social posts and emails that will be viewed and revered) by hundreds of thousands of people around the world and know that your ability to proofread them is as important as your ability to move people with them.

You are a self-reliant and organized professional who can get shit done quickly without hand-holding. We’re a small company that is growing very fast. While we understand that highly creative people are not always highly organized people, we refuse to believe these two qualities can’t exist in the same bag of blood and bones. Hopefully you do too.

You are a social savant. Someone who hangs out in the niches of TikTok. You’re on the pulse when it comes to music and cultural trends.You know how to create engaging on-brand content for a world that's obsessed with cool transitions and Megan Thee Stallion.

You are a veritable Swiss army knife of creative skills and you like to stare down lots of different challenges. You may start the day knocking out a design for an event invite, slip into a mid-morning strategy session for how to promote our Digital Studio on IG Reels, slip out of your home office cocoon (and one day our physical office) to take The Class…for free…because well…that’s a fun job perk and we believe in keeping your body and mind healthy and happy, round out the day designing and organizing our social posts for the next few days, and be distracted from your end of day walk around the neighborhood dreaming up a different way for us to appeal to a new and important demographic of our audience. What am I trying to say? The job involves doing very, very big things and very, very little things. If you like that breadth and depth - this is your jam.

You have between 1 and 1MM years of experience.

You like and respect what comes from working on a diverse team of human beings, all of whom bring something different in their approach, personality, background, and experience. We embrace diversity in all things we do, so if that doesn’t feel like your jam, this is not the nest you seek.

You are a self-reliant and organized professional who can get things done without hand-holding. We’re a small company that is growing very fast. We value people who thrive in environments where autonomy and resourcefulness are the orders of the day.

You are not afraid of having conversations about (and interpreting) data and metrics but you also understand (and would like to work with people who believe) that “magic” and raw creative lightning in a bottle is an essential element of driving business forward.

You are (or can be) based in NYC.

You are human. We need and want people who are thoughtful, candid, and humble. It’s important in a “we’re not just saying it’s important because it sounds nice” way. Our mission is literally to help people feel better (in their bodies and their minds). It matters.

If you have worked on the front lines in any business where your role is primarily customer-facing, that’s a big plus. Our business is intensely focused on our community and customer service (and just knowing and understanding what it means to “have a customer”) is core to what we do.
Additional Information

To Apply:
If you are interested, please apply with a resume, a link or links to some of your work, and a note written by a human being (ostensibly you) to another human being (me).
I’m the Director of Marketing at this place but definitely not a member of an “HR department” so I encourage you to tell me who you are. I value candor, a direct expression of your experience, and clear ambitions. Write towards those attributes instead of telling me what you would think I would typically “need to hear” in a job application. Be yourself. The truth is the easiest thing to remember and I don’t have tons of time to weed through cover-letter-speak to find out who you really are. Just tell me.

Using Solution Based Casework, we actively work with parents to help them develop a more active, consistent and productive role in their child’s educational and social development; we encourage families to build connections to positive supports in their community who will help them sustain their progress.

Simons Foundation,8 days ago,NYC,"Summer Research Assistant, Simons-NSBP Scholar",,NA,"The Simons-NSBP Scholars Program (SNSP) is an exciting new program that provides undergraduate NSBP members with unparalleled summer research opportunities. The 8-week program, which is a partnership between the Simons Foundation and the National Society of Black Physicists, gives its Research Assistants a holistic experience and provides invaluable training for becoming a professional physicist.
Program Description

The SNSP has a number of components that are specifically designed to provide Scholars with the best experience possible.
Research: SNSP Scholars work on a wide range of projects that have included modeling gravitational waves in the early universe, developing sensors for measuring the Cosmic Microwave Background, and searching for new exoplanets. Each of these projects is at the cutting edge of its field, and our Scholars have been able to make valuable contributions to the projects on which they have worked. This year there will also be Quantum Physics and Biophysics projects.
Speaker Series: There are a number of black physicists working on exciting projects in a variety of areas. Every week of the SNSP, the Scholars hear from a new speaker about their work. The 2020 speaker series featured, among others, Derrick Pitts (Chief Astronomer at the Franklin Institute), Carol Scarlett (Professor of Physics, Florida A&M University), and Delilah Gates (Graduate Student of Physics, Harvard University)
Professional Development: The SNSP has weekly programming to help Scholars advance their careers. These workshops discuss topics ranging from graduate school applications to writing documents in LaTex.
Social Events: Life isn’t all work! Every week Scholars gather for events where they can put their work aside and focus on having fun. In 2020 these ranged from video games to cooking.
The 2021 SNSP may be in-person and/or remote, as described below. Given the conditions of the COVID pandemic, all in-person components are contingent on our ability to proceed safely.
If in-person, scholars will work in New York City and work on projects with scientists at the Center for Computational Astrophysics, Center for Computational Biology, or Center for Computational Quantum Physics. A small number of experimental projects may take place at Princeton University in Princeton, New Jersey.
If remote, scholars will work remotely with scientists from a number of institutions around the US and Canada. These Scholars will attend the Opening Ceremony in person and be involved in all programming.
The program will have all the components listed in the Program Description above. The specific details for 2021 will be provided when the program begins.
The 2021 SNSP will kick off with an Opening Ceremony on June 14 at the Simons Foundation in New York City (assuming this is possible given the pandemic conditions). All Scholars (remote and in-person) will be flown to NYC for the ceremony and an intense 5-day programming boot camp.
Compensation

This is a paid, seasonal, full-time research internship at the Simons Foundation. More information regarding the logistics will follow, depending on whether the internship will be in-person and/or remote.
Eligibility

The SNSP is open to undergraduate members of the National Society of Black Physicists. We especially encourage applications from (i) students entering the final year of undergraduate studies and/or (ii) students studying in non-graduate degree granting departments.

At Cutover, we’re focused on helping Enterprise teams move quickly with confidence. We’ve come a long way in a short space of time: doubling our global team to 100 people, bringing on board multiple top-tier Enterprise clients (including some of the world’s largest Financial Services institutions), and having Index Ventures lead our recent $17m Series A round all in the past 12 months. What’s even more exciting to us, is that our Cutover journey is just getting started...

We’re thrilled to be scaling our Revenue Operations team in early 2021 and have opened up the search for a talented RevOps Analyst to come join us ahead of our biggest year to date. Our RevOps Analyst will work closely with (and report into) our Director of RevOps and have a core focus on enabling us to build and scale Cutover’s commercial engine as we grow from 100 to 250 employees over the coming couple of years. It’ll be a diverse, fast-paced, and exciting role for someone who loves getting their hands dirty in the building-phase of a project and understands the power that comes from bringing world-class process, tooling, training and a data-driven focus into an early stage commercial organization (rather than trying to reverse engineer stuff when it’s too late!).


What we’d like you to bring to the table for this role...

You’ll ideally have 3-5 years of experience in Operations/Analytics (in Finance, Marketing, Sales, etc - and will likely have some sales and/or account management experience in your background, too); this experience range is more of a guide than a mandate, so if you feel you’re a great fit for this role and have more/less experience than outlined, we’d still love to hear from you.
1+ year of experience in Revenue Operations (we’d like you to have some RevOps fundamentals under your belt, so we’re prioritizing those who have already started their RevOps journey at this time).
Experience working in a fast-paced environment (ideally at start-up/scale-up software companies); delivering at pace and managing broad responsibilities is something we think will set you up well here.
Admin-level ability in the standard tech stack (Salesforce.com, Hubspot, MixMax, Sales Navigator, Gong, etc; experience in some - or all - of these would be highly preferable)
Excel/Sheets power user and to be highly confident analysing complex data.
Experience managing the end-to-end sales commissions calculation process - you’ll be familiar with supporting leadership ensuring that data is correct and calculations occur in a timely and accurate manner.
You have next-level time management and prioritization skills - juggling multiple work streams comes naturally to you.
You’ll be patient and willing to teach: training others on tools and processes will be a key part of this role, so having a great ‘bedside manner’ and an excitement to help others learn and succeed is important..
You are mature, accurate, and credible in your written and verbal communication style; you’re able to build relationships with more senior folks internally (commercial leadership and the broader Executive Team).
Confidence executing Apex for automation purposes would be a cherry on top of the cake (although not mandatory).


The opportunities you’ll have to learn and grow as our RevOps Analyst at Cutover...

You’ll be an early member of a scaling commercial organization and the second person in our Global RevOps function: you have the opportunity to set the benchmark and progress quickly. We see this role developing into a Manager-level position over time and we’d love to support you on your route to getting there.
You’ll get to work cross functionally with members Sales, CS, Account Management, Delivery, and Marketing - building an awesome network and learning (“staying curious” is one of our core guiding principles).
You will become the guardian of data for our commercial functions: ensuring processes and reporting is accurate and consistent will be a large part of what you’ll do. With this will come the opportunity to develop and improve the status quo: if you see something’s broken, we want to empower you to fix it.
You’ll be given a motivating compensation and plan to reward you for your stellar work and you'll be allocated share options in a Series A business backed by a truly world-class investment team at Index Ventures (we’re all co-owners and are genuinely invested in Cutover’s future success).
You'll have a strong benefits plan: 20 days of PTO (+ NY Public Holidays), top-tier private health insurance package, upcoming 401k contribution plan, work-from-home stipends (we're going to continue as a remote-first team for the foreseeable), and all the company swag you could ever need."

Oatly Inc.,9 days ago,NYC,Inventory Manager (Remote),,NA,"Hello potential future Oatly employee. It’s us, the original oatmilk company that started in Sweden back 25 or so years ago and has since expanded to the U.S. where we’ve continued growing at a rate such that we need more brilliant minds to come work with us to keep the momentum going and the oatmilk flowing.

Sustainability, health, and transparency are the core values that guide everything we do. Basically, we exist to make it easy for people to eat better and live healthier lives without recklessly taxing the planet’s resources in the process. If any of this resonates with you, then maybe you’d like work for Oatly, too. Now onto the formal stuff.
We are looking for an Inventory Manager to join our team. The chief goal in this position will be to manage a team of inventory analysts that monitor and report on our company’s finished goods inventory levels at our 3PLs. You will be responsible for managing a team in developing inventory tracking systems, reviewing levels of finished goods, and performing a daily/ weekly/ monthly analysis, including inventory reconciliations between our 3PLs WMS systems and our ERP. You will also oversee the closing of sales orders in our ERP that will allow for inventory to be decremented in our system and invoicing to occur. Additionally, you’ll be the key point of contact for our Finance team during monthly closes.
Here are the things we want to hire you to do:
Design and implement inventory control/tracking processes and identify systems functional requirements to optimize inventory control procedures
Define, oversee the development and preparation of detailed reports on inventory operations, stock levels, adjustments, shipments, and receipts into our 3PL
Perform analysis to predict potential inventory problems
Oversee the timely entry of daily deliveries and shipments to update inventory

Serve as main conduit of information between Transportation departments and Customer Service departments
Work with the S&OP and Planning departments to identify optimal inventory levels by Distribution Center (3PL)
Work with inventory accounting in reconciling inventory on hand and value at our 3PLs
Here are the things we think you need:
Bachelor’s degree in in Supply Chain discipline or equivalent or relevant field experience
Experience with building inventory controls and processes from scratch a plus
A minimum of 5-10 years’ experience in a similar role
Solid knowledge of data analysis, inventory management software, ERP systems (preferably Microsoft D365) and forecasting techniques
Outstanding organizational and problem-solving skills
Excellent communication and leadership abilities
An analytical mind with strong attention to detail
Here is another list of qualities we think make a good Oatly team member:
You feel connected to our mission of encouraging health, sustainability, and transparency
You are a self-starter who doesn’t need direct supervision to motivate you for success – we believe strongly in building a culture of individual accountability and ownership, and Oatly needs partners that can embrace that mentality and be able to exceed expectations while working independently
You are ready to make your mark in a smaller, growing brand leveraging your experience to deliver amazing results to continue building an outstanding company
You have entrepreneurial spirit; in that you are comfortable with ambiguity and are energized by the process of building something lasting from the ground up
You enjoy sharing your quirkiness and talents with your coworkers
Another bulleted list felt redundant, so we wrote this long sentence with all the ways we sweeten the deal to work with us, like providing flexible vacation for starters, really great benefits with 100% medical coverage, genuinely great coworkers who want to see the company and each other succeed, a start-up vibe with an established company history, and a fridge full of the best non-dairy alternative in the world for your enjoyment.

There you’ll find our mission, track record, services, and how those who have partnered with us feel about us.

We reply within minutes, sometimes hours.- an eye for creating operational and team efficiencies- phone presence and social skill as well as empathy to support staff and clients- a sense of urgency: for example, you do not like to have bold-faced emails in your in-box- grammar skills as you will correspond with clients and advisors- patience and social grace as you will get asked a lot of questions by 40-55 advisors and 150-200 clients regarding how to guide clients (what to do next, how to do X, where to find Y), or school related questions- the capacity to handle candor as the founder is direct with her guidance.

If so, read on and find out how the Trauma-Informed Schools approach and an extraordinary communication skill set called Nonviolent Communication (NVC) can transform any school's culture especially in this period of the health crisis and the long overdue reckoning with systemic racism. Our work directly addresses this paradigm shift.We ask this important question:We spend 12 years in school preparing for a career.How much time do we spend preparing for a relationship?Any relationship?Have you been asking this question along with the rest of the population? With the increase in youth suicides, bullying, social cruelty, self-harm, uncensored media, and now partial/full isolation from schools and colleges, offering Relationship Education that focuses on respectful communication is ever more necessary.The Relationship Foundation is seeking interns for:researchcurriculum developmentsocial mediawebsite developmentgrant researchnewsletter and blog contentpresentations and webinarsInterns are needed now (fall and winter), and into the spring/summer. This is currently an unpaid internship, but that could soon change as our program gains more acceptance in schools and organizations. We've given eight remote trainings for over 400 schools. We have also been asked to give trainings for mental health workers and psychologists who work with First Nations populations (aka American Indians) in the west and in North Dakota. We are also working with the Mt. Sinai Hospital system in New York to develop a curriculum for medical students and residents. And finally, we are working with an organization that supports individuals on parole.If you are a college student, a graduate, or even if you've been out in the world a while, this internship will give you a sense of purpose and you will learn relationship skills you may never have imagined were possible to embrace.Here is what we do and who we are:The Relationship Foundation (TRF), a 501(c)3 non-profit has been teaching its ""Healthy Relationships 101"" program in high schools in New York City and in cities in several other states for over twelve years. We instruct students and teachers on how to sustain healthy, thriving, meaningful, and fulfilling relationships with everyone in their lives. (and now how to have these during limited social access)One of the most effective things we do is support students and teachers to articulate their needs and feelings without blame and judgment and to listen empathically; everything we wish we had learned growing up. Given how disconnected (or over-connected) our society is today, learning this work can make all the difference both in and out of school.The communication skill set we teach is based on Marshall Rosenberg's ""Nonviolent Communication (NVC),"" and the results from this approach have been extraordinary. See our website for details. Equally as important is introducing the Trauma-Informed Schools approach to help schools' staff to understand that so called problem students are actually kids with toxic stress in their brain chemistry due to abuse, neglect, and unstable home lives (or homeless lives). Understanding this changes how kids are treated and the positive outcomes are phenomenal. The Trauma-Informed approach with a disruptive student is not what's wrong with you, but what's going on with you? We also go into detail about the neuroscience of trauma and how decreased neural networks can be regenerated.One administrator called our work, ""CPR for the Soul.""We have a book, a curriculum for schools, and a guidebook for organizations that are available on our website. Our guidebook for facilitators is being used by women's organizations and has been requested by other social service organizations, domestic violence prevention groups, mental health clinics, prison counselors, and therapists.Candidates will be selected for the skills they bring to the organization and their commitment to the organization's mission. A motivated self-starter with a keen sense of organization is a must.Excellent typing and computer skills are also required.As an intern, you will become a valued staff member and learn the history of the project, gain new insights, and help to focus on opportunities to maximize their potential.This is an extraordinary opportunity for someone who dreams big, wants to join a non-profit on the brink of wider recognition, and desires to make a difference in the world. We're closing in on grants and an increase in paid services so the internship could lead to initial compensation and eventually a paid position.

Our experts have delivered fully integrated software solutions to well over 30 North American utilities.

Our team members become deeply engaged with each of our partners, providing both deep utility and vendor specific domain expertise, ensuring we provide our clients with holistic solutions that scale with our partner operations and customer expectations. We draw upon our experience delivering these solutions for the past decade and enhance them with the expanse of experience and capability of TRC.

ExpandED Schools,9 days ago,NYC,STEM Educators Academy Program Manager,,"$32,500 a year","ExpandED Schools is a leading afterschool organization that advances educational equity for students from under-served communities across New York City. Founded in 1998 with a catalytic $125M grant from the Open Society Foundations, ExpandED designed the nation’s first city-wide, publicly-funded system for afterschool programming. Today, through advocacy, research, and program development, ExpandED continues to build the capacity of the NYC afterschool field to address the educational inequities that prevent far too many students from reaching their full potential.
Now more than ever, under-served students need access to innovative, engaging ways of learning to help them deal with the trauma of the pandemic and racial injustice and make up for lost learning time due to the public health crisis. In the face of remote learning and cuts to city and state budgets, ExpandED is designing online programming, organizing and uniting partners across the afterschool field, and leading the fight for urgently-needed public funding to ensure kids from communities most affected by COVID-19 will continue to have access to a robust public education, whether in-person or remotely.
ExpandED Schools is seeking a Program Manager to support STEM Educators Academy, a program designed to support afterschool and school-day educators in collaborative educator teams in offering exciting, enriching design-based learning activities in afterschool. STEM Educators Academy features three programmatic tiers, matching professional development, on-site coaching, funding, and technical assistance to sites’ needs and interests. In addition, the program has a cadre of “Graduate Coaches,” program veterans who’ve moved into independent implementation and are now sharing their gifts and talents with sites in Tiers 1-3 via coaching, training, and resources. The candidate will join the team during a dynamic period of growth and scaling, as we seek to reach additional sites, adjust the program model in a changing world, and position the program for greater scale within the NYC STEM education ecosystem. This is a time-limited, grant-funded position; beginning at 50% part-time through June 30, this position will grow to 100% time from July 1, 2021 through December 31, 2021.

Manage coaching-related communications and logistics (scheduling, reminder communications, follow-up communications, etc.)
Help community partners and schools establish STEM programs; establish routines, protocols and reporting mechanisms to ensure successful implementation of program
Create and/or edit program support materials as needed to support program implementation (which may include lesson plans, site visit report forms, program support one-pagers)
Complete evaluation reports, using the Dimensions of Success Observation Tool for the official evaluation of the program, as needed.
Document and disseminate best practices in the informal STEM field, including professional development strategies
Serve as a thought partner for areas of on-going programmatic growth, using learning and insights from in-field coaching to inform evolving program strategy. Key area of focus would be curricular revision for anti-racist lens and identity-affirming content.

FireEye is the intelligence-led security company. Working as a seamless, scalable extension of customer security operations, FireEye offers a single platform that blends innovative security technologies, nation-state grade threat intelligence, and world-renowned Mandiant® consulting. With this approach, FireEye eliminates the complexity and burden of cyber security for organizations struggling to prepare for, prevent, and respond to cyber attacks. Learn more about FireEye's world-class solutions and global footprint at https://www.fireeye.com/company.html.

Job Description

Does finding new intrusions give you goosebumps? Do you like learning and sharing info about new attacks with your peers, your clients, and with the world? Are you hungry to track threat actors, curate threat data, work with a range of other teams, and most importantly, elevate the discovery of new and interesting things to FireEye and to the public?
Advanced Practices is finding net-new evil across all FireEye customers, and we’re looking for tenacious researchers who love the thrill of the hunt to join our team. As a Principal Security Researcher, you will be part of the Advanced Practices team focused on reverse-engineering adversary tradecraft and operationalizing what we learn for the highest echelon of subversive threats.
The best candidate will be driven to discover new intrusion activity and find creative ways to distil the voluminous threat data from our weak signals down to new and interesting findings for our clients. When we find new things, it is important to drive that knowledge into FireEye and, when possible, into the public through blogs and contributions into other notable forums such as public threat analysis frameworks. We encourage giving back to the security community and strongly support sharing of expertise. Our team members are encouraged to author whitepapers, develop free tools, and speak at conferences as well.
About Advanced Practices:
FireEye’s Advanced Practices team was created in 2015 to track and respond to the most difficult threats facing our clients and our own company. Our team of experts work together to track, correlate, attribute, and detect attacker activity using advanced analysis and deep research into adversary methods. Advanced Practices codifies and makes actionable the knowledge from thousands of Mandiant incident response cases, Managed Defense engagements, and all significant evil from over 6,000 global FireEye product clients.
Illumination. Advanced Practices shines light in the darkest corners to expose and amplify complex adversary activity. We search for the nearly imperceptible traces of attackers wherever we can find them, and we seek to surface their activity for action.
Front-line Visibility. Our team of 25+ talented security researchers and threat analysis professionals bring decades of experience investigating intrusions, analyzing malware, and dissecting digital artifacts to deliver front-line innovation in FireEye’s products and services.
Threat Discovery. Our goal is simple: to know the most about adversaries and make this knowledge actionable. Advanced Practices enables early discovery and analysis of adversary operations and their tradecraft so that our customers are protected.
It’s How that Works. Our team studies the world’s most impactful intrusions from the front-lines of FireEye Mandiant and Managed Defense to understand how apex attackers operate. Our focus on technical evidence and how our adversaries operate powers the engine that highlights who our adversaries are.
Surfacing the Unseen. We look for unique features and common adversary methods across all intrusions and malware so we can develop resilient monitoring, detection, and discovery of attacker activity. We set proactive traps and develop threat signals to capture real-time and historic adversary activity from important, evasive, and emerging threats.
Summary of the role:
Lay the foundation: research, model, and integrate threat data
Build the layers: search through telemetry to find new intrusions, malware and tradecraft
Assemble the dish: notify our clients and affected organizations then close detection gaps
Icing on the cake: push research findings from the team into blogs and other public formats when applicable
What You Will Do:
Hunt for emerging threat activity across all available FireEye telemetry: discover net-new malware families, intrusion activity, and suspicious events associated with Advanced Practices and notify our customers
Analyze technical threat data to extract TTPs, malware techniques and adversary methods with low (or no) detections, and help close those gaps within the FireEye platform
Drive FireEye detections and technology through threat expertise and knowledge
Provide threat context and integration support to multiple FireEye service lines
Provide threat research and context to global service delivery for Mandiant investigations
Perform threat research and analysis during high-severity cyber-attacks impacting FireEye customers globally

Traditionally, today’s old-school financing companies require contractors to pay a percentage of their project in exchange for financing. This results in an average loss of 20-40% of the profit margin, while rejecting many homeowners who don’t have excellent credit.We’ve built a software solution that empowers contractors to win more jobs by offering attractive payment options to homeowners, without paying dealer fees, and while being able to serve a large community of customers.Performance to Date: We launched about 30 months ago and are profitable. We have 1,500+ paying customers (unlike most startups) and are completely bootstrapped. We’ve built partnerships with top lending networks of America (Goldman Sachs, LendingClub, SoFi, etc.) as well as banks and credit unions and are currently sitting on ~$30B in capital to deploy through our platform.Our lean but scrappy team consists of experienced industry veterans in the digital credit, B2B SaaS, and enterprise-software spaces, as well as folks who are from the trades/home-services and get it.

That means together we will make decisions, make mistakes, and make improvements.About You (Personality): - You're hungry as hell. You're extremely results oriented. You don't make excuses and find ways to get the job done, period. You have a clear and powerful reason why you need to succeed right now.- You have Grit. You can take damage day after day.
